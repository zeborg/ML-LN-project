Isn\u2019t that person\u2019s speed too terrifying?\u201d Seeing that the Dou Huang had managed to quickly escape from the obstruction of the Snake-People and successfully chase after him, Xiao Yan felt the skin on his head turn numb. He hurriedly shouted in his heart, \u201cTeacher!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, for the remaining journey, allow me to support your escape. The other side has too many people so we cannot be delayed by them. Otherwise, even if I can bring you to escape, that \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 will be stolen away by them!\u201d At the moment, Yao Lao\u2019s voice had an additional seriousness. A lineup formed by a Dou Huang and three Dou Wangs was something that even he could not look down upon right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk. I\u2019ll leave it to you. Regardless of what happens, we cannot lose the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 again.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head heavily and earnestly requested with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I know!\u201d</p><br/><p>After agreeing with a smile, Yao Lao gradually descended into silence. An incomparably ferocious Spiritual Strength violently surged out from Xiao Yan\u2019s body. In the blink of an eye, it gained control of Xiao Yan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>As Yao Lao\u2019s Spiritual Strength surged out, Xiao Yan\u2019s body trembled slightly. A faint purple-colored cloud tattoo formed on the back of the Purple Cloud Wings as light purple lines gradually surfaced. The slow swimming light within the lines made it seem like a living thing which was both mystical and mysterious.</p><br/><p>This kind of strange phenomenon would only appear when the Purple Cloud Wings were pushed to its limits. With Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength, he did not have the ability to achieve this. However, this was something very simple for Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>After the purple cloud lines surfaced on the Purple Cloud Wings, Xiao Yan\u2019s flying speed appeared to instantly skyrocket to over double its original speed. The insane flying speed released a sonic boom as it passed through the air. From this, it could be seen just how frightening Xiao Yan\u2019s current speed was.</p><br/><p>Following the surge in Xiao Yan\u2019s speed, the gap between him and Gu He\u2019s group, which had been gradually narrowing, was immediately widened.</p><br/><p>Gu He and the two others adopted stunned expressions as they watched the human figure a great distance in front of them who appeared to be teleporting. A powerlessness rose in their hearts. This kind of speed was far too fast. It could be compared to the speed of a Dou Huang of the wind affinity.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that guy is also a Dou Huang?\u201d</p><br/><p>The thought flashed quickly in Gu He\u2019s heart, prompting his face to change slightly. However,, he quickly tightened his fist violently. Even if the opponent was a Dou Huang, Gu He would never allow him to successfully take the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 away. He had offered extremely generous rewards in order to invite Yan Shi and Feng Li of the Ten Strongest people in Jia Ma Empire, to take the risk of entering the inner desert and accompany him to steal the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Thus, no matter what happened, he would not give up on this \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019! Even if the other person was a Dou Huang, it was impossible for him to give up!</p><br/><p>When Xiao Yan\u2019s speed rose drastically, the expressions of both Yan Shi and Feng Li by Gu He\u2019s side became extremely ugly. Clearly, they had thought along the same lines as Gu He.</p><br/><p>The two of them exchanged glances and shook their heads with bitter smiles. Wanting to obtain the generous reward that Gu He had mentioned was expectedly not easy. Originally they had rejoiced at Queen Medusa\u2019s disappearance but they did not expect that another mysterious and strong person of unknown origin would once again appear. These continuous twists and turns of events had caused the two strong people renowned in the Jia Ma Empire to feel helpless and bitter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was indeed something that would cause many strong people to become crazy\u2026\u201d After muttering with a bitter smile, Feng Li tilted his head around and watched the somber and furious face of Gu He. He did not expect this usually relaxed and easygoing alchemist grandmaster would have difficulty maintaining his usual demeanor in front of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. This allowed Feng Li to personally experience the temptation of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cChase! I want to see just where this strong person comes from. As long as we know his identity, I don\u2019t believe that there is someone in the Jia Ma Empire that I, Gu He, cannot offend!\u201d Gu He suppressed his anger and snorted. The pair of Dou Qi wings on his back flapped and his speed suddenly increased by quite a bit as he swiftly chased after the small black dot in the far distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, Old He seems to have really become furious. I wonder where that strong guy originates from? If it is the Jia Ma Empire, I\u2019m afraid he will be very unlucky\u2026 Offending a tier six alchemist. That is not something fun to do.\u201d Looking at Gu He whose anger had already surfaced, Yan Shi could not help but part his mouth and laugh.</p><br/><p>Feng Li nodded his head. Indeed, a tier six alchemist was someone that even a Dou Huang would not easily dare to offend. After all, the nepotism of an alchemist was really a little frightening. As long as he knew your identity, he could invite a large number of good friends daily and take turns to attack. Even if he couldn\u2019t beat you, he might tire you to death.</p><br/><p>However, even with the increased speed of Gu He and the two others, they continued to remain far behind Xiao Yan. The distance between them was also growing. This situation caused Gu He to be so furious that his face turned livid but he remained helpless. After all, they had already pushed their speed to their peak. It was already impossible for them to go any faster.</p><br/><p>Just as Gu He was gritting his teeth with anger at the increasing distance, a black shadow caught up with them in a lightning like manner from far behind them. In an instant, she appeared in front of them.</p><br/><p>Seeing the black-robed person that had appeared in a flash just a short distance away, a joy immediately surged onto Gu He\u2019s face. At the same time he let out a sigh as he hurriedly shouted, \u201cQuick, stop that guy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d A faint voice was emitted from under the black robe. However, the black-robed person did not immediately speed up. Instead, her speed slowed slightly. She turned her body around, raised her head and exposed her snow white elegant chin under the blazing sun before whispering, \u201cI will chase after him. You should all separate immediately and fly out of the Tager Desert on your own. After that, we will gather at Yan City outside the Tager Desert! If I manage to catch up to that person, I will take the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do we need to separate?\u201d Hearing the words, Gu He was at a loss and asked in a stunned manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strongest among the Snake-People are catching up. Their speed is extremely quick in the desert. Moreover, they have already gathered five Dou Wangs. If I continue to protect you, I can safely send all of you out of the desert. However, I\u2019m afraid that I won\u2019t be able to chase the person ahead\u2026\u201d The black-robed person said blandly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlready?\u201d Gu He\u2019s heart was slightly shocked. He mused for an instant, and decisively called out, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s split up. I\u2019ll leave the person in front to you. You need not worry about the rest of us. Although we cannot face the strong Snake-People head on, it should not be too difficult for us to leave the desert!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d The black-robed person nodded slightly. After some reminders, she flapped her green-colored pair of Dou Qi wings and chased toward the place where Xiao Yan disappeared in a lightning like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll leave it to you. You must take the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 back!\u201d Watching the black-robed person, Gu He shouted. He waited for the former to disappear from sight before he frowned and turned around to glance at the horizon. He said gravely, \u201cOld Shi, Feng Li, let\u2019s split up, Remember, we\u2019ll meet at Yan City. Be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, alright. It\u2019s a pity. I had originally wanted to have a big fight with the Snake-People. But from the looks of it, it seems we won\u2019t have the chance.\u201d Yan Shi nodded his head and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be plenty of opportunities. Now, they are superior in numbers, let\u2019s withdraw first.\u201d Gu He gave a forceful smile as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you don\u2019t need to be too worried. You should know Sect Leader Yun\u2019s strength well. She should be able to catch up to the guy in front.\u201d Seeing Gu He\u2019s face, Feng Li smiled and comforted Gu He.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, hopefully. If she still fails, then it may be that I am not fated to have the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d Gu He let out a soft sigh. He placed his hands together and shook it toward the other two before saying seriously, \u201cThe two of you, be careful. I will take my leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying this, the pair of wings on his back flapped. He then turned around and shot toward the edge of the desert.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, let us leave too.\u201d Seeing Gu He\u2019s back disappear, Yan Shi and Feng Li also smiled. The wings on their back flapped and they turned around before flying in different directions.</p><br/><p>A short while after the three of them disappeared, five glows flashed over like falling stars. A moment later, they stopped at the place where Gu He and the other two had stood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have separated!\u201d After sensing for a moment, Yue Mei frowned and faced the other four, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s split up and give chase. Yue Mei, the three of you will go and chase Gu He and the other two. Yan Ci and I will go after the Dou Huang.\u201d A Snake-Person wearing gray robes said. This Snake-Person was fairly old with a face full of wrinkles. It was clear that he had quite a high reputation among these people. Thus, when they heard his arrangement, even the bad tempered Yan Ci did not say anything to oppose him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Yin, you and Yan Ci are no match for the Dou Huang. In the sacred city, she easily managed to escape even when the three of us attacked together.\u201d Mo BaSi said with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax. We will not confront her head on. I have been leaving some markings along the way here. If Nan She and the others were to arrive and follow the markings to catch up to us, WE will attack together. That Dou Huang would not have an easy time. On the other hand, if the few of you manage to catch up to the opponent, you must give them a memorable lesson. They had haughtily charged into our Snake-People race\u2019s territory. If they leave without any losses, won\u2019t that cause our Snake-People race to lose face?\u201d The gray clothed old man\u2019s voice was somewhat hoarse and cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Yue Mei\u2019s pretty face was completely icy. She nodded and did not say any other unnecessary things. After the three of them exchanged glances, the Dou Qi wings on their back flapped and three of them flew in the direction of Gu He and the other two in a lightning like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Yan Ci! I had once exchanged blows with the three Dou Huangs of the Jia Ma Empire. If I can come into contact with the black-robed person, I should be able to identify him. Even if he escapes, our Snake-People race will be able to take revenge for this wrong.\u201d Seeing Yue Mei and the two others swiftly disappear, the gray clothed old man narrowed his muddy old eyes and said faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Yan Ci nodded his head. A ferocious glint danced in his eyes. With a flap from the wings on his back, he and the gray clothed old man turned into two light rays and shot in the same direction as the black-robed person from before.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
