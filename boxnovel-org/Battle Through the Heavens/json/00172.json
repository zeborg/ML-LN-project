His hand trembled slightly as he reached forward, intending to hold that small jade bottle in his hand.</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiao Yan\u2019s action, a mocking glint flashed across the muddy eyes of Gu Te who was seated opposite him.</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Yan touched the small jade bottle, his heart abruptly tightened. He found that the spot on his hand that came into contact with felt a coldness that pierced his bone. In the blink of an eye, his palm was covered with a layer of thin ice. In addition, the ice swiftly spread up Xiao Yan\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>The unexpected change caused Xiao Yan\u2019s expression to change slightly. An idea struck him and threads of purple colored Dou Qi in his body quickly passed through a few QI Paths and finally flowed to his arm. Instantly, a faint purple colored flame rose from Xiao Yan\u2019s arm and came to a brief stalemate with the icy air before gradually melting it.</p><br/><p>His arm shook slightly and threw off the water stains on it. Xiao Yan\u2019s hand was covered in a pale purple colored flame as he once again grabbed the small jade bottle. This time round, he lifted it up without any change in his expression.</p><br/><p>Beside him, Gu Te watched the Purple Flame that burnt and soared on Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. A surprised expression flashed across his face as he cried out involuntarily, \u201c\u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019? No\u2026\u201d After feeling the strength of the Purple Flame, Gu Te shook his head slightly. He looked intently at the young man in front of him and softly said in his heart, \u201cWhat a guy. I was actually mistaken. This guy is not someone simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Gu Te\u2019s gaze, Xiao Yan focused on carefully studying the small jade bottle in his hand that was continuously releasing icy cold air. He carefully opened the bottle cap and revealed half a bottle of cream white liquid. On top of the liquid, one could faintly see some ice-like things. Xiao Yan gently inhaled a breath of cold air from the bottle. Instantly, his body violently shivered. The Purple Flame Dou Qi in his body circulated for a moment before it forced the thread of icy air out from his head.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan extended his hand and touched the top of his head. He was stunned to find that a thin layer of ice crystals had formed on it. He immediately smacked his lips together. This \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 was indeed a rare unique treasure. No wonder one must have its help when swallowing a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. From the trend of his thoughts, Xiao Yan could also vaguely feel just how frightening the strength of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was\u2026 it actually required a few different types of unique things to work together in order to raise the success rate by a little\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan cautiously studied the \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 for a long while. Only when Yao Lao confirmed it in his heart did Xiao Yan hurriedly place it back into the white jade box.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have already obtained what you want. Leave if you having nothing else\u2026\u201d Painfully watching the \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 being stored by Xiao Yan in his storage ring, Gu Te\u2019s face twitched as he waved his hand in an attempt to chase him out.</p><br/><p>Having obtained what he needed most, Xiao Yan sighed with relief in his heart. He cupped his hands together and shook it at Gu Te. With a smile, he said, \u201cGrandmaster, thank you for your help. If I have any opportunity in the future, I will definitely come here to exchange with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm hmm. Come find me when you are able to take out some ingredients. Otherwise, the old me will not see anyone.\u201d Smacking his mouth, Gu Te rudely said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. If I am not able to take something out, I will not dare to come and disturb you.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded before glancing all around the room. He randomly asked, \u201cGrandmaster Gu Te. Do you happen to have a rank three monster core with you? If you have\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRank three monster core?\u201d Rolling his eyes, Gu Te purposefully said with disdain, \u201cDo you think that I would keep something of that grade?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d Seeing the unhappy Gu Te, Xiao Yan was speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, you need a monster core? I don\u2019t have a rank three one but I have one rank five monster core in my collection. Do you want it? Hehe, all you need is to take out another bottle, no, half a bottle of the \u2018Amethyst Lion Birth Essence\u2019 and I will exchange it with you!\u201d Gu Te rubbed his hands together. His face suddenly became less hostile and the smile of his was like a cunning wolf.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026 Grandmaster Gu Te really likes to joke. That bottle of Amethyst Essence is really all that I have. I won\u2019t be able to take out any more of it.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled dryly and shook his head. Although a rank five monster core was valuable, that was something that could be obtained if one had the strength. However, the \u2018Amethyst Lion Birth Essence\u2019 was a rare item that relied on one\u2019s luck and could not be easily obtained. Moreover, even if Xiao Yan obtained a rank five monster core, he had no use for it and would only attract envy if he kept it with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Grandmaster Gu Te doesn\u2019t have a rank three monster core, then I will stop by at the auction house. Heh, goodbye.\u201d Smiling at Gu Te, Xiao Yan gradually turned his body, opened the door and walked out under Gu Te\u2019s unhappy gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Bastard, I don\u2019t believe you\u2026\u201d Gu Te sat down on the chair and was at a slight loss as he frowned, \u201cXiao Yan? I seem to have heard this name somewhere. Where\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of the room, the old man in drab scratched his hair as he thought deeply.</p><br/><p>------</p><br/><p>The sound of footsteps caused Ao Tuo to turn around as he saw Xiao Yan, whose face was full of smiles. He could not help but ask in a stunned voice, \u201cHave you gotten it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh. Yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding his head with a smile, Xiao Yan cupped his hands together and expressed his thanks, \u201cIf it were not for Grandmaster Ao Tuo\u2019s help today, I\u2019m afraid that I would really have to run all around the world in search of this \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t much. These things will only be decorations if placed with that old man. With his ability, he would be unable to use them. By giving them the chance to end up in the hands of someone who needs them, it can be considered that I have done a good deed.\u201d Ao Tuo smiled and shook his head. His gaze swept across the young man in front of him and could not help but be amazed in his heart. After having known Gu Te for so many years, he naturally knew that the old man would not give in without some incentive. Originally, he did not hold much hope when he led Xiao Yan over. After all, what kind of rare and unique items can an alchemist who had just reached tier two take out?</p><br/><p>However, the smiling young man in front of him had personally informed him that the item had been secured. This was something that made Ao Tuo very curious. He was curious as to what kind of thing would be able to move that stingy monster.</p><br/><p>Although the curiosity was a little intense, Ao Tuo did not ask the question. He was not a novice who had just left his home. After muddling along for so many years, he naturally knew some of the rules of an exchange. Hence, even if his heart was as curious as a cat\u2019s paw, he wisely chose to avoid this question.</p><br/><p>Since Ao Tuo did not ask, Xiao Yan naturally would not reply. In this way, both of them understood each other as they chatted with smiles while they walked out of this messy and strange building.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still need a rank three monster core?\u201d After leaving the room, Ao Tuo heard the information that Xiao Yan unintentionally revealed. He tilted his head and posed the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded before saying softly, \u201cI will be leaving Black Rock City today and head to the Empire\u2019s eastern border. Thus I need to prepare everything I will need, here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHead to the border of the empire?\u201d Hearing this, Ao Tuo momentarily stilled. He quickly smiled and nodded as he voiced his thoughts, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this. You will first accompany me to the Alchemist Association to wait. As for that rank three monster core, I will send someone to help you obtain one from the steward of the auction house. This way, you can save the time you would have needed to go to the auction house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words, Xiao Yan felt a desire to accept it. He did not pretend otherwise as he nodded with a smile. \u201cThen I\u2019ll trouble Grandmaster Ao Tuo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, since you have registered at our Black Rock City\u2019s Alchemist Association, you can be considered one of us. This little bit of trouble is nothing\u2026\u201d Ao Tuo shook his head and carelessly replied.</p><br/><p>Ao Tuo\u2019s words clearly had faint signs of trying to butter up to Xiao Yan. Regarding this, Xiao Yan only hesitated a little before nodding his head. In the Jia Ma Empire, the Alchemist Association was undoubtedly a huge organization that would not lose to the Misty Cloud Sect. Becoming one with them would not be detrimental to him in any way. Moreover, if he needed to refine medicine in the future, he would need some rare and strange things. When that time comes, the exchange system of the Alchemist Association was extremely accesssible. Thus, Xiao Yan was not too resistant to this matter.</p><br/><p>Of course, the main reason for Xiao Yan to agree without too much hesitation was that there was not too many restrictions in the Alchemist Association. During ordinary days, everyone worked on their own things and did not bother one another. On occasion when the Alchemist Association needed help, they may distribute invitations to get some alchemist to help. The help given was naturally not free. Once it was properly completed, the Association would give a good amount of compensation.</p><br/><p>Soon after the two of them returned to the Alchemist Association, Ao Tuo gave the order for someone to help Xiao Yan purchase a rank three monster core before inviting Xiao Yan into the living room to wait there quietly.</p><br/><p>In the spacious living room, Ao Tuo carried a cup of tea and placed it in front of Xiao Yan. He thought quietly for a while before suddenly asking, \u201cXiao Yan, how long are you planning to spend in your trip to the empire\u2019s border?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe around half a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf a year\u2026\u201d Tapping his finger gently on the table, Ao Tuo smiled and said, \u201cHalf a year later, will you go to the capital of Jia Ma Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCapital?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan momentarily stilled. He pressed his lips tightly together and nodded. In his heart, he coldly said, \u201cOf course I will go. The Misty Cloud Sect is just outside the capital. How can I not go?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh.\u201d Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, the smile on Ao Tuo\u2019s face became a little more obvious. The gaze he gave Xiao Yan was also gentler.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster Ao Tuo\u2026 is something the matter?\u201d Seeing Ao Tuo\u2019s manner, Xiao Yet felt unnatural as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is indeed something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding his head with a smile, Ao Tuo gently said, \u201cHalf a year later, the upcoming Alchemist Grand Meeting will occur in the capital. I think that if you have the spare time then, you can take part in it. It would be very beneficial to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Alchemist Grand Meeting?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan\u2019s face was clearly at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring the Alchemist Grand Meeting, not only will there be many alchemists from the Jia Ma Empire participating, there will also be some alchemists from other empires in the Dou Qi continent who will come and join. This is a great event in the Jia Ma Empire Alchemist scene. It would be a pity to miss it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you wish to join when that time comes, you can come to the capital\u2019s Alchemist Association Headquarters to find Frank or me. By then, we will all be there.\u201d Seeing some interest from Xiao Yan\u2019s face, Ao Tuo said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, alright. If I\u2019m free then, I will definitely go and take a look.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded; it could be considered that he accepted Ao Tuo\u2019s invitation.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xiao Yan had nodded his head in agreement, Ao Tuo smiled and nodded too. Then he told Xiao Yan some important things regarding the Alchemist Grand Meeting that the latter needed to take note.</p><br/><p>During the time the two of them were talking, the person who had went to the auction house to purchase the rank three Monster Core had also rushed back. He respectfully handed it to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>The value of a rank three Monster Core would not be lower than two hundred thousand. However, this money was rejected by a smiling Ao Tuo. With the wealth from the Alchemist Association, spending this bit of money was really like a drop in the ocean.</p><br/><p>When faced with this rank three Monster Core that he obtained for free, Xiao Yan could only helplessly accept it. The two of them chatted for a while longer before Xiao Yan finally got up and bid his farewell. Today, he would leave Black Rock City.</p><br/><p>With a smile, Ao Tuo saw Xiao Yan out of the Alchemist Association. He watched Xiao Yan\u2019s back as it slowly disappeared to nothing before he smiled and whispered, \u201cXiao Yan, I will be waiting at the Alchemist Grand Meeting for you. I hope you can display your talent at that scene\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}
