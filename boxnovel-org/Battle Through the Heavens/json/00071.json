Her two hands carried a silver tray, and in the center of the tray was a faint red ring.</p><br/><p>Taking the silver tray and sending back the maid, Ya Fei personally handed over the goods to Xiao Yan and smilingly said: \u201cOld Sir, the cauldron as well as all the alchemic ingredients you need are all in the \u2018Storage Ring\u2019\u201d.</p><br/><p>Extending a hand to pick up the storage ring, Xiao Yan let it roll about in his palm then faintly nodded. Yao Lao\u2019s voice also sounded out at just the right time: \u201cOkay. After refining the Qi Gathering Pill, I will bring it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ya Fei\u2019s pretty eyes were filled with delight as shei hastily nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, there\u2019s no need for you to send me out. I\u2019ll go out by myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Waving his hand, Xiao Yan took the ring and slid it onto his finger. Then, without even turning back, he headed towards the back of the parlor and went out. On the table, the blue jade card was still there as he did not want to owe the people too much. Thus, he had just left it there.</p><br/><p>Staring at the receding figure leaving through the door, Ya Fei nibbled her red lips, then stepped forward to take the blue jade card into her hand. Musing a bit, she asked in a clear voice: \u201cUncle Gu Ni, to refine a Qi Gathering Pill, the success rate is not that high right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s said that even Pill King Wang Gu He\u2019s success rate for refining Qi Gathering Pills is only around 7 out of 10. For normal fourth tier alchemists, the success rate is only around 5 out of 10,\u201d Gu Ni said in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this old sir, he succeeds in refining on the first try\u2026\u2026\u201d Ya Fei said as she knitted her thin black brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows, maybe his luck is good\u2026\u2026\u201d Gu Ni shook his head and didn\u2019t care too much about the matter. After all, for alchemists, luck was a big factor in successfully refining pills. If one\u2019s luck was good, even when continuously refining several times, one would not fail.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026\u2026 that he\u2019s not just a fourth tier alchemist?\u201d Ya Fei asked with hesitation after pondering a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, how is that possible. The number of fifth tier alchemists in Jia Ma Empire can be counted on one\u2019s hands. At that sort of status, even if it was the empire or great forces like the Misty Cloud Faction, they would all view this person as a VIP. Why would such a person come to our own auction house to auction pills.\u201d Gu Ni laughed.</p><br/><p>At this, Ya Fei also slightly nodded her head and let out a sigh, bitterly laughing: \u201cIt seems that I don\u2019t have enough experience. I\u2019m afraid that my previous hesitation negatively impacted this mysterious alchemist\u2019s favorable impression of us by a large amount.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame yourself for this. That kind of huge transaction, even I wouldn\u2019t dare to answer easily. That you are capable to this extent is already very good. In regards to our relations with that alchemist, in the future, just take your time and get along amiably. As long as he does not develop any sort of ill will towards us then it\u2019s fine.\u201d Gu Ni said comfortingly.</p><br/><p>Forcing a smile to her face as she nodded, Ya Fei sat lethargically on the chair, revealing her figure. As her lovely eyes blinked, having some doubts, she softly asked: \u201cWhat does he intend to do with so many low-grade medicine ingredients?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose medicine ingredients have the effect of stopping bleeding and strengthening bones. I think he should be planning to manufacture healing medicine.\u201d Gu Ni muttered as his eyebrows pursed together. Similarly puzzled he said: \u201cBut with his status, why would he manufacture these cheaply-priced healing medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ya Fe\u2019s beautiful eyes slightly narrowed, her long fingernails lightly tapped on the table. A moment later, realization dawned upon her, she softly said: \u201cLooks like this old sir seems to be very caring towards the Xiao Clan\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Eyebrows wrinkled tightly together, Gu Ni\u2019s expression suddenly changed into one of amazement: \u201cAre you saying that he wants to give the Xiao Clan healing medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRecently I\u2019ve heard that the Jia Lie Clan had invited over a first tier Alchemist. The cheap \u201cReturn of Spring Powder\u201d has already snatched away half of the city\u2019s crowds, if the Xiao Clan does not act soon, I\u2019m afraid that their marketplaces will end up embarrassingly empty.\u201d Ya Fei eyes darted around as she voiced out her conclusion, smugly smiling she continued to explain: \u201cPreviously, the old sir had already said that if there was a chance, he would co operate with the Xiao Clan and buying so many healing ingredients at this time could only mean one thing: he meant what he said.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, looks like the Xiao Clan has really lucked out this time, while the Jia Lie Clan is going to be in trouble.\u201d Having listened to Ya Fei\u2019s analysis, Gu Ni grinned. An envious look was on his face since obtaining the help of a fourth tier Alchemist was not something just any clan could receive.</p><br/><p>Slightly inclining her head, Ya Fei gave an easy smile as she said: \u201cWe should also make some contact with the Xiao Clan soon, though adding a flower to a bracelet will make one somewhat happy, providing help when one needs it the most is a much better way of strengthening both parties ties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Ni approvingly nodded his head, with a fourth tier Alchemist behind them, ties with the Xiao Clan were now important.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Exiting the auction house, as usual, Xiao Yan prudently turned round and round the streets for at least half a day before finally taking off his disguise in a desolate alley.</p><br/><p>Tossing and catching the light red \u201cStorage Ring\u201d in his hand, Xiao Yan was somewhat happy. This kind of Storage Ring was made by a type of uncommon material called \u201cStorage Stone\u201d. The characteristic of this material was that there was a unique small space within it where any lifeless objects could be stored. Though this was extremely convenient, due to the sparsity of the \u201cStorage Stone\u201d, its was extremely precious. The lowest grade \u201cStorage Ring\u201d in Xiao Yan\u2019s hands only had a space of about three to four square metres, yet it costs almost 100,000 gold. In the Xiao Clan, Xiao Yan had only seen his father and the first Elder own Storage Rings.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan fiddled with the Storage Ring for a while, hesitatingly examining it. In the end he did not wear it but rather carefully stored it in his bosom. This kind of ring was considerably pricey, if it was seen by his father or others, he would have a hard time explaining how he came to obtain it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan kicked the black mantle into the gutter before carefully walking out of the desolate alley. Afterwards he quickly dashed back to his clan.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Yan followed the lane that passed through the clan home, he heard his father\u2019s furious voice from Meeting Room. Eyelids twitching, Xiao Yan moved forward to secretly peer through a crack in the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, Jia Lie Bi that bastard is too much, he actually dared to brazenly steal our business!\u201d Within the room, Xiao Zhan was currently raging as he pounded on the table. Tea from the teacups spilled all over the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cPresently, the marketplaces of the Xiao Clan had already lost a great amount of traffic. The merchants left in the marketplace are also very worried and frightened. A few of them have even secretly left for the Jia Lie Clan\u2019s marketplaces. If this continues, in another half a month I am afraid that\u2026\u2026. our marketplace will go bankrupt.\u201d The second Elder said with a gloomy face as he gnashed his teeth together in fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about\u2026\u2026 I bring a few of our clan\u2019s elites and secretly deal with that alchemist?\u201d The third elder\u2019s gaze were ferocious as he suggested this in a dark tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are at least two Da Dou Shi protecting the Alchemist, it won\u2019t be so easy.\u201d Xiao Zhan helplessly said as he moved his hands to and fro.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if we continue in this manner, our losses will be too great. The profits from the marketplaces of Wu Tan City is a large part of the total revenue of our Xiao Clan.\u201d The Third Elder was somewhat unwilling to back down.</p><br/><p>The corners of Xiao Zhan\u2019s mouth twitched. At the moment, he could not think of any good ideas.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat day at the auction, didn\u2019t that mysterious alchemist say that there might come an opportunity where he would work with us? Seeing how Gu Ni was so respectful towards him, his tier as an alchemist is definitely not low. If he could help us, then that Jia Lie Clan would definitely lose out.\u201d The First Elder, who had been silent up until now, suddenly spoke up in a soft voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, who knows if he just randomly blabbered. For people of that kind of status, what kind of benefits would they get out of cooperating with us? For such little profit, would they even care?\u201d Xiao Zhan laughed bitterly and shook his head as he sat on the chair and sighed.</p><br/><p>The three elders were all silent as well. Indeed, it was a bit challenging for the Xiao Clan to establish connections with people of such status.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k. We\u2019ll bear it for a few more days. If the Jia Lie Clan still does not practice restraint then don\u2019t blame us for retaliating no matter the costs!\u201d Licking his lips, Xiao Zhan gripped onto the chair frame as an ominous glint flashed across his eyes.</p><br/><p>Outside the door, listening up till here, Xiao Yan faintly shrugged his shoulders as his hand played with the storage ring at his chest. Letting out a cold smirk, he slowly left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
