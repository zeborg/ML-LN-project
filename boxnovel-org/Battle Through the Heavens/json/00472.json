There were over ten people standing around or sitting within this room. At this moment, there was some anger on the faces of these people.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss, that \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 really doesn\u2019t know what is good for them. They actually dared to beat up Fu Ao until he is in such a state. If we do not get back at them, how will our \u2018White Gang\u2019 survive in the Inner Academy in the future?\u201d A man in the room suddenly could not control himself as he slammed his palm on the table, and cried out furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Boss, we cannot let Big Brother Fu Ao just suffer this beating.\u201d The voice of that man had just sounded when the remaining people in the room went along with it and demanded uniformly.</p><br/><p>A man was leaning on the back of his chair as he was seated on the leader\u2019s seat in the room and his palm fondled his chin. Looking at his appearance, there was a faint similarity between him and Bai Shan. It appeared that he should be the leader of the \u2018White Gang,\u2019 Bai Shan\u2019s older cousin and that strong person who was ranked thirty-fourth on the \u2018Strong Ranking,\u2019 Bai Cheng.</p><br/><p>Bai Cheng ignored the people in the room who were rousing to action as a group. His gaze stopped on a human figure on his left side. At this moment, half of the face of this human figure was wrapped in gauze. From the half side of the face that was exposed, one could vaguely identify this person. He was Fu Ao, who had fainted on the spot after Xiao Yan ruthlessly swung a punch at his face today.</p><br/><p>\u201cFu Ao, how are your injuries?\u201d Seeing this miserable manner of Fu Ao, the man involuntarily frowned as he opened his mouth and asked.</p><br/><p>As he opened his mouth, the noisiness in the room immediately became quiet. Everyone's gaze paused on Fu Ao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not suffer any overly serious internal injuries. However, I will need to rest for four to five days in order to be able to fully recover.\u201d A somewhat changed voice of Fu Ao was being emitted from the mouth belonging to Fu Ao, who had half of his face wrapped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the strength of that Xiao Yan like?\u201d Bai Cheng nodded slightly and narrowed his eyes. That calm voice of his contained a thread of dark coldness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis own strength is merely around that of a five or six star Da Dou Shi. However, he seems to be able to use a kind of Secret Technique in order to forcefully increase his own strength, raising it to the Dou Ling class. Additionally, the flame which he uses is also extremely domineering and powerful. The combination of a Dou Technique and an item agglomerated from Dou Qi attack which I had displayed were all neutralized by that domineering flame.\u201d A disatisfaction flashed across Fu Ao\u2019s eyes. The anger in his voice also became richer, \u201cOriginally, I would not have lost so miserably, but who would expect that the fellow actually knows a sonic Dou Technique. He took advantage of me when I could not defend, shaking me until I became absent-minded, and launched a heavy blow to beat me up until this manner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Cheng nodded slightly. He turned his heads to one side. The cold-faced Bai Shan was seated there. The latter nodded when he saw Bai Cheng looking over and said faintly, \u201cOlder Cousin, the details are roughly the same as what Big Brother Fu Ao had said. That Xiao Yan does indeed possess these skills. In addition, he also knows an even stronger Dou Skill. That is the mysterious flame that he used to attack Luo Hou with back then. For some unknown reason, he did not use it today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have also heard of that fire lotus Dou Technique. It is indeed very strong but it seems to be very exhausting. With Xiao Yan\u2019s strength, he may perhaps be only able to display it once or twice in his peak condition.\u201d Bai Cheng nodded and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss. This time around, I was at a disadvantage because I didn't know the details. If we were to fight him next time, I would definitely not lose!\u201d Fu Ao said with extreme dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still think that you have not embarrassed yourself enough?\u201d Bai Cheng\u2019s face sunk. His palm abruptly slammed on the table. His clear voice shocked everyone in the room until they did not dare interrupt.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you had not given that so called promise before fighting today, I would bring people to crush the \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 and get them to disband immediately. However, you, a fool who thinks highly of yourself, actually dared to make such a promise after clearly knowing that Xiao Yan had defeated Luo Hou. Now that the agreement has been spread throughout the Inner Academy, won\u2019t we end up being bad-mouthed if we go and find trouble with \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 now? There are quite a number of people in this Inner Academy who are waiting to see us, the \u2018White Gang,\u2019 embarrass ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do? We cannot just simply let this pass so easily, no? If we were to act like nothing happened, it would not be beneficial to the reputation of our \u2018White Gang.\u2019\u201d Fu Ao could only soften his voice because of the reprimand by Bai Cheng as he replied indignantly.</p><br/><p>Bai Cheng lifted the teacup beside him and took a shallow sip. He lifted his head and was quiet for a while before slowly speaking, \u201cYou have already promised not to find trouble with \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 for half a year. Therefore, for a brief period of time, the members of the \u2018White Gang\u2019 should try to avoid having conflicts with them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOlder Cousin, you are thinking of leaving Xiao Yan\u2019s group alone for half a year?\u201d Bai Shan could not help but ask with a frown after he heard this.</p><br/><p>Bai Cheng held the teacup tightly, and mused a little before nodding. He said faintly, \u201cThey won\u2019t be able to become much stronger in half a year. At that time, I will personally issue a challenge to \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this a little too risky? Who would know what kind of unexpected changes would happen in half a year\u2019s time? That Xiao Yan is not someone that can be handled with common sense.\u201d Bai Shan said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax. Even if they were to spend every single day of this half a year training in the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,\u2019 they would at the very most reach the peak of the Da Dou Shi class. It is not so easy to advance into the Dou Ling class. Moreover, I am also not a fool like Fu Ao. Even if I have absolute confidence in winning, I will not promise a one on one. At that time everyone from the \u2018White Gang\u2019 will move together. I want to see if their \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 can still struggle to stand.\u201d Bai Cheng waved his hand and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Bai Shan still hesitated a little when he heard this. During the period of time when he was living alongside Xiao Yan in the forest, he had seen Xiao Yan create quite a lot of miracles that caused people to be endlessly shocked. Hence, he continued to have an uncertain feeling in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is only the initial plan. We will decide based on the situation at that time. Get someone to observe every single action of this \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019...\u201d Seeing that Bai Shan was still slightly perturbed, Bai Cheng could only helplessly shake his head and change his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it is already quite late. Everyone should dispense. Tomorrow, I will enter the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 to train. It will perhaps be five to six days before I will come out. During this period of time, you, Fu Ao and the other two will look after the matters within the gang.\u201d Bai Cheng stood up and commanded faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>......</p><br/><p>In the morning of the next day, when the sky had just brightened, the lights in the new students\u2019 residence area were brightly lit. Numerous human figures came rushing out from their rooms before they finally lined up orderly in front of the small pavilion home of Xiao Yan\u2019s four-man group.</p><br/><p>\u201cCreak\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A long while later, the door of the small pavilion home was slowly pushed open. Xiao Yan\u2019s four-man group slowly walked out. They stood in front of the door and eyed those high-spirited members of the \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate,\u2019 whose faces were filled with excitement, smiling involuntarily. Although these members were currently still quite weak, their potential was quite great. As long as they were given sufficient time, Xiao Yan believed that they would sooner or later become true strong people.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the members were all gathered, Xiao Yan did not say any other unnecessary words. He waved his hands, and took the lead along with Wu Hao, Xun Er, and Hu Jia as they swiftly walked toward the exit. The over forty new students followed close behind.</p><br/><p>On the road that led to the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,\u2019 the students coming and going eyed that large group of people who passed by them with a \u2018Hu La\u2019 sound. They could not help but be a little stunned. When some of those with sharp-eyes saw Xiao Yan and the large Heavy Xuan Ruler he was carrying on his back, surprised voices immediately sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Isn\u2019t that Xiao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, he appears quite handsome\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two girls that are following by his side also appear to be very beautiful. Hee hee, I wonder who will be lucky enough to get on intimate terms with them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese people should be the new student faction \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 which has caused an uproar in the Inner Academy recently, right? It seems that their aura is quite good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that even Fu Ao from the \u2018White Gang\u2019 was beaten by Xiao Yan yesterday. Looks like this fellow does indeed have some strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c......\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a gentle breath as he heard the various private conversations as they passed by. Now their \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 could be considered to be famous in the Inner Academy. However, their current strength and reputation did not appear to match.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shook his head and ignored the discussions the people around were having over him and \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019 He let out a urging sound and the speed of the group increased. After which, they carried a slip of dust as they swiftly disappeared at the end of the road\u2026</p><br/><p>After walking for nearly an hour, the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,\u2019 that merely exposed its peak, finally appeared in their sights. When the people from \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 saw that extremely mysterious tower, surprised sounds involuntarily appeared one after another.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, is this the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower?\u2019 It is indeed very unique to be actually buried underground.\u201d Xun Er eyed that extremely large tower, and let out a sweet soft laugh in a lovely manner, attracting quite a number of surprised gazes from the men who were waiting at this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He led everyone to occupy a spot which was not too near the front. According to the rules of the Inner Academy, this \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 had a strict opening and closing time. Hence, Xiao Yan\u2019s group could only patiently wait for the door of the tower to be opened.</p><br/><p>As time slowly flowed passed, the human flow around them also became increasingly large. The noisy sounds as well as the human flow that gathered caused everyone in \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 to be shocked. It was unexpected that the Inner Academy possessed such a number of people despite the extremely harsh condition to enter it.</p><br/><p>The spot where Xiao Yan\u2019s group was, was undoubtedly the place which attracted the most attention. During these few days, Xiao Yan and the matter of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 being formed had already become the focus of attention of the entire Inner Academy during this period of time. Moreover, the matter of Xiao Yan defeating Fu Ao and causing the \u2018White Gang\u2019 to fall back had further intensified the spreading of this reputation.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s group was seated cross-legged as they ignored the noisy voices and various looks they received around them.</p><br/><p>Time continued to flow past like the sand between fingers. Over twenty minutes since Xiao Yan had arrived, there was suddenly a group of people who had squeezed out from within the crowd. After which, they slowly walked toward the spot where Xiao Yan\u2019s group was at.</p><br/><p>As this group of people walked forward, the gazes around gathered onto them. After seeing the leader of this group, their gazes turned toward the place where Xiao Yan\u2019s group was at. Their eyes carried some delight from watching the fun.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere which had suddenly become strange caused Xiao Yan to open his eyes. He raised his head, and threw his gaze toward the group of people that walked over, and could not help but frown slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, be careful. That fellow is the leader of the \u2018White Gang,\u2019 Bai Cheng!\u201d Atai, who was beside Xiao Yan, wore a solemn expression as he softly informed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head slightly. He waved his hand and the dozens of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 members who were seated cross-legged on the ground let out a \u2018swish\u2019 sound as they stood up in union. Numerous gazes stared intently at Bai Cheng\u2019s group which was slowly walking over.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the atmosphere outside the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 had turned somewhat tense.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
