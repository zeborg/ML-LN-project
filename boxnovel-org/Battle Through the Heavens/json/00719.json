Immediately, a rainbow sword glow flashed from the mountain behind the Misty Cloud Sect. Within a couple of breaths, it appeared in the sky above this messy open ground.</p><br/><p>The rainbow glow scattered, revealing the human figure within it. She was wearing a black dress. Her smooth, black hair gently flowed down her shoulders, passing over her pretty waist and gathering near her backside. Her female eyebrows appeared like a picture while her skin was like icy snow. Her pretty face was somewhat skinny but it coincidentally formed a perfect contour that caused people to involuntarily let out praise within their heart. What a pretty girl\u2026</p><br/><p>The woman who had suddenly appeared was also startled because of the mess in the open ground. Her gaze immediately turned to Yun Yun in the sky who was looking at her with a startled look. That pretty face which seemed to be broken with a blow immediately revealed a heart moving smile. A clear voice that was filled with pleasure sounded from the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYanran\u2026 you\u2026 you have really broken through the Gate of Life and Death?\u201d Yun Yun greatly rejoiced as she looked at the lady who was a little more matured compared to a few years ago. Hearing the way that Yun Yun was addressed, the lady who had appeared was surprisingly the one who had an inextricable relationship with Xiao Yan, Nalan Yanran!</p><br/><p>The Dou Qi wings on Nalan Yanran back were flapped slightly as she swiftly rushed to Yun Yun side. Her gaze looked all around her before she pressed her eyebrows together and inquired, \u201cTeacher, what has happened to the Misty Cloud Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Yun Yun\u2019s pretty face was withdrawn slightly when she heard this. Her voice was somewhat grieved as she said, \u201cYanran\u2026 the Misty Cloud Sect, might be finished\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran\u2019s lovely body trembled. She also seemed to have sensed that something was not right. Her gaze swiftly swept across the open ground in detail and her eyes immediately shrank as they paused over Yun Shan and those Elders who had lost their lives on the open ground. Shock drifted into her eyes. She immediately clenched her silver teeth and hissed, \u201cThis\u2026 who did this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran\u2019s eyes turned toward the sky while her mouth spoke these words. She suddenly stiffened as she faced that somewhat familiar black-robed figure. Her gaze carried some disbelief as it slowly shifted upward before finally stopping on the face that was covered with traces of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you are Xiao Yan? Why are you here?\u201d Although that face was covered by fresh blood, Nalan Yanran still managed to recognize it immediately. She let out an involuntary cry upon doing so.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is unexpected that you have also reached this stage after having not seen you for a couple of years\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan was also somewhat surprised as he studied Nalan Yanran. He could sense that the latter\u2019s strength was also at the peak of the Dou Wang class at this moment. Moreover, looking at the trend of the fluctuations of her aura, it actually had traces of being able to breakthrough to the Dou Huang class anytime. He could not help but feel shocked at this. He had trained bitterly for three years and had help from swallowing the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 in order to reach this stage. It was unexpected that this woman\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the Dou Qi in her body may be powerful, it does not truly belong to her. From the looks of it, she seems to have inherited some strength. Only when she has truly refined this strength will she be able to control it perfectly. From the looks of it, this should be a kind of inheritance of the Misty Cloud Sect. Her luck is indeed quite good.\u201d Yao Lao by the side slowly spoke. Given his sharp eyes, he was naturally able to see the situation within Nalan Yanran\u2019s body at a glance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan only sighed in relief when he heard Yao Lao say this. No matter how he grew, he still possessed the desire to compete with this lady who had nearly become his wife.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the one who is responsible for what happened to the Misty Cloud Sect?\u201d Nalan Yanran slowly recovered from her shock. She immediately seemed to have understood something as her delicate hand pointed below and spoke furiously, \u201cXiao Yan, you can come and look for me if you have a problem. Why must you find trouble with the Misty Cloud Sect? Those matters back then have long been resolved. It is unexpected that you have actually not forgotten about them. Are you still considered a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with you. There is no need to take the blame for everything. You don\u2019t have that qualification nor that ability\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s voice was indifferent as he glanced at the furious Nalan Yanran, \u201cThe Misty Cloud Sect has caused my father to go missing, my big brother to become a cripple, and even nearly killed every single member of my Xiao clan. Given this blood feud, do you expect me to act like a saint and generously forget such acts? If a man were to act like this, what difference would he be from a coward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran\u2019s pretty face changed slightly when she heard Xiao Yan\u2019s ice-cold voice that was void of any feeling. She spoke in a deep voice, \u201cYou are speaking nonsense. Given the position of our Misty Cloud Sect in the Jia Ma Empire, how is it possible for us to do those things to the Xiao clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour teacher is just beside you. Why don\u2019t you open your mouth and ask? That way, you will know just what kind of things the noble Misty Cloud Sect that you speak off has done during these few years.\u201d Xiao Yan mockingly shook his head as he replied.</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran\u2019s gaze turned to Yun Yun by her side when she heard this. The latter, however, shifted her gaze away from Nalan Yanran\u2019s somewhat pale pretty face. She clenched her silver teeth and hissed, \u201cI have also been put under house arrest during these few years. Those matters\u2026 are all things done by your grand-teacher in his muddiness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran\u2019s head immediately felt giddy when she heard these words of admittance by Yun Yun. Just what had happened to the Misty Cloud Sect during these few years? Given the extraordinary position of the Misty Cloud Sect, how could they commit these kinds of rude and unreasonable bandit-like acts?</p><br/><p>\u201cEarlier, your grand-teacher was defeated by Xiao Yan\u2019s hands. However, in the end, his spirit was forcefully snatched away by this demon. The spirits of a couple of other Elders were also swallowed by it!\u201d A fury once again surged onto Yun Yun\u2019s pretty face when she spoke about this. She turned her head and faced Protector Wu, who was wearing that strange dark-black armor. He was suspended in the sky and spoke furiously.</p><br/><p>Although Nalan Yanran\u2019s heart was once again shocked when she heard Yun Yun mention that Yun Shan was defeated by Xiao Yan, her gaze quickly turned toward Protector Wu in the sky. Her eyes narrowed and her pretty face slowly became solemn. She could vaguely sense that this mysterious fellow had an extremely frightening strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what exactly happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will explain to you after everything is over. Now, we must take revenge for those Elders whose spirits have been swallowed first!\u201d Yun Yun waved her hand. Her pretty face swiftly became chilly as her gaze swept over the white-colored fog that had had surged out from the Misty Cloud Sect disciples below. She turned her head and spoke in a deep voice to Nalan Yanran, \u201cYanran, help me control the formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Nalan Yanran was somewhat helpless at meeting such an unexpected turn of events upon leaving her retreat, she chose to immediately follow Yun Yun\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun did not delay any longer when she saw Nalan Yanran nod. Her hand seal changed and the countless amounts of white-colored energy fog spreading below swiftly floated up. Finally, they gathered beside her like a sea of clouds.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun waved her delicate hand while being in the middle of the sea of clouds. The only three elders that remained also rushed up and immediately appeared within the sea of clouds. Their hands waved and the white-colored cloud swiftly fluctuated, bringing about a powerful energy ripple.</p><br/><p>\u201cCovering Sun Cloud Formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>The cool cry was emitted from Yun Yun\u2019s mouth. Immediately, the sea of clouds fluctuate and agglomerated into a large energy sword, over a hundred feet in size and covered with mysterious cloud lines. The enormous sword trembled slightly and the powerful energy contained in it shook the air until it fluctuated slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon, go and die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Yun\u2019s hand ruthlessly struck the sword hilt and the enormous sword immediately rushed toward Protector Wu in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, you want to deal with this protector with such a broken formation? You really overestimate your own strength!\u201d Protector Wu shook his head with disdain when he saw the enormous sword that was shot over while carrying a sharp sword aura. He immediately let out a dark, cold smile before waving his sleeves. A strange black-colored fog rushed out from his sleeve before covering the enormous sword within it.</p><br/><p>The black-colored fog seemed to contain an extremely corrosive ability. The moment the black fog made contact with the enormous cloud sword, it swiftly corroded all of the enormous energy that was contained in the latter. Under this unusual corrosion of the black fog, Yun Yun lost her relationship with the enormous sword. Hence, she could only watch as the enormous cloud-colored sword swiftly became fainter before completely disappearing.</p><br/><p>The powerful attack that gathered all the strength of the experts from the Misty Cloud Sect did not actually have the slightest effect on the current Protector Wu!</p><br/><p>Yun Yun and Nalan Yanran\u2019s expressions changed slightly when the attack was completely useless. The strength of Protector Wu had far exceeded their expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Yun Yun viciously clenched her silver teeth but was unwilling to give up. Her hand seal moved and the sea of clouds once again fluctuated suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn irritating fly!\u201d Protector Wu\u2019s face also sank when he saw Yun Yun attacked once again. The repeated attacks of the former had caused him to become a little irritated. He immediately let out a low, dark, cold cry. An unusual dark, majestic energy suddenly surged out of his body. Immediately, it formed an enormous black-colored hand, over a hundred feet in size, within the air. Finally, it smashed violently down toward the position where the sea of clouds was located.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!...\u201d The sound appeared one after another.</p><br/><p>The black-colored energy handprint was extremely fast. In merely the blink of an eye, it appeared above the head of Yun Yun and the others in front of their shocked eyes. It immediately smashed down angrily. The frightening energy that erupted at that instant caused the Dou Qi that the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s disciples agglomerated to be shaken until it cracked apart.</p><br/><p>Grug! Grug!... the sound was deafening.</p><br/><p>Those Misty Cloud Sect disciples below were also implicated when the sea of clouds broke. Immediately, most of the people below displayed pale faces as they involuntarily spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun, Nalan Yanran, and the other figures in the sky swiftly withdrew. They only stabilized themselves a moment later. All of their faces were extremely ugly. It was unexpected that this fellow was actually so strong. Their combined strength was unable to even last one exchange with the other party!</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, the heavens really do want to eliminate our Misty Cloud Sect\u2026\u201d Yun Yun\u2019s bright eyes were filled with defeat as a bitterness seeped out from the corner of their mouths.</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran by the side also clenched her teeth tightly. Meeting an enemy that she could not contend with the moment she left her retreat was quite a big blow to her.</p><br/><p>The Protector Wu\u2019s target was clearly not the remains of the Misty Cloud Sect. Hence, he slowly turned his gaze toward Xiao Yan and Yao Lao after pushing back Yun Yun\u2019s group. He revealed a dark, cold smile. His voice was filled with a dense killing intent that resounded across the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, today, none of you will escape. I want the spirit and I also want the people from the Xiao clan!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}
