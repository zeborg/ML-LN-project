As he approached the underground magma world, the surrounding air also became much hotter.</p><br/><p>A faint jade-green flame flowed from Xiao Yan\u2019s body, isolating the high temperature of the outside world. His gaze stared at the pure-red color below, and he gently inhaled a breath of air. A caution quietly rose within his heart. This kind of place was not one that was used to play. It was really dangerous here. It was definitely not wrong to be careful. The vague summoning feeling earlier continued for a short instant before it scattered and became invisible. This kind of strange scene caused Xiao Yan to wonder if it was an illusion.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan continued down for awhile before his eyes suddenly widened. At this moment, the thing that appeared in front of him was a magma world that was vast, and seemed to be endless. The large bright-red magma pool emitted a hot energy that caused one to feel asphyxia. Even though one was near it, the hot air caused one to have difficulty enduring on. Enormous bubbles surged out of the magma and appeared on the surface. Finally, they burst apart one at a time. Waves of hot air, accompanied by white smoke, spread from them. The vapor that originated from deep underground possessed a shocking heat and a smell that made one uncomfortable. It was rumored that this kind of vapor contained a kind of fire poison that would cause one quite a lot of trouble if one absorbed it into one\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>A thought passed through Xiao Yan\u2019s heart as his jade-like bone wings slowly spread from his back. The wings gently flapped and stabilized his body above the magma world.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze cautiously swept around him as his body remained suspended in mid-air. This magma world was the same as it was when he had left it back then. It was deadly silent and did not contain the slightest hint of life aura. All it had was the slight reverberating sound of the magma bubble exploding, which caused this place to be even quieter. The magma was extremely viscous, so it would usually not form any magma waves. In any case, everything in this place gave one a silent feeling. If one were to live in this place for a long time, it was likely that one\u2019s character would become strange and withdrawn. It was fortunate that Xiao Yan had descended into a near-death state back then and had been unaware of the situation in the outside world. Otherwise, those few years would have been difficult to endure.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan felt somewhat relieved when he thought of this. After an investigation in which he did not discover anything wrong, he finally flapped his bone wings and came to a spot beside the mountain wall. He drew his Heavy Xuan Ruler and his wrist moved rapidly. Rock fragments flew and a ten-foot-large hole swiftly appeared in the tough mountain wall\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan easily created a small cave where he could rest with the help of the high temperature of the Glazed Lotus Flame. After doing all of this, Xiao Yan did not immediately land on the magma and practice the \u2018Six Joint Body Flowing Ruler.\u2019 Instead, he sat down cross-legged within the mountain cave and gradually shut his eyes. After which, he entered his training state.</p><br/><p>Following Xiao Yan\u2019s entrance into his training condition, the surrounding space immediately began to intensely fluctuate. Bright-red energy that could be seen with the naked eye surged in all directions. Finally all of it fought to rush into Xiao Yan\u2019s body\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment this bright-red energy poured into Xiao Yan\u2019s body, his shut eyes were suddenly opened. A wild joy and solemness flashed in them. The degree of energy that filled this place had far exceeded his expectations. However, the wild violence within the energy had also exceeded his expectations. If one absorbed too much of such energy, it was likely that it would affect one\u2019s character. Moreover, such influence was something that Xiao Yan could not accept even if he would obtain a training speed that far exceeded his usual speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fortunate that I was prepared\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled after musing for a moment. He flicked his hand and a cluster of jade green flames rose. Finally, the cluster completely covered his hand.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan used his other hand to flick his finger when the flame appeared. A couple of items appeared in front of him. Finally, under his control, these items were left suspended in mid-air. These few items belonged to the category of medicinal ingredients and their bodies emitted some chillness. At one glance and one could tell that these medicinal ingredients either contained ice type or water type energy.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes gave a random glance before waving his hand. A couple of cold affinity medicinal ingredients landed into it. The current him was a genuine tier 6 alchemist. If he were to refine an ordinary medicinal pill, he would be able to do it like Yao Lao where he used his palm as a cauldron and refined the ingredients as he desired.</p><br/><p>Under the control of Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Strength, the few kinds of cold affinity medicinal ingredients were swiftly refined. A cold, thick-white liquid slowly surfaced\u2026</p><br/><p>This time around, Xiao Yan was not refining a medicinal pill. Instead, the items were just things to help with one\u2019s training. It was just like some of the things Yao Lao had refined to help him train when he had first headed out back then. Hence, this did not consume too much time. After merely ten minutes or so, the impurities within the pool of cold liquid were completely expelled.</p><br/><p>A crystal clear, cold liquid lingered within the flame. Xiao Yan flipped his hand and a small jade bottle appeared. After which, he tilted the bottle and some cold, bright-red liquid blood flowed out. Finally, it fell into the flame and merged with the other cold liquid.</p><br/><p>Following the merger of the two, the color of the liquid also changed. After the grilling by the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, a thick, pale-white liquid was finally formed. Coldness radiated out of it, blocking the surrounding hot temperature.</p><br/><p>Seeing the successful refinement, the jade-green flame on Xiao Yan\u2019s hand also gradually scattered. He beckoned with his finger and the faint-white, viscous liquid fell into a jade bottle. After completing this refinement, Xiao Yan swiftly removed his clothes, and poured the cold liquid over his body, covering every inch of it.</p><br/><p>An ice-cold feeling immediately covered his body when the cold liquid was scattered over it. His originally fiery, hot skin swiftly turned ice-cold. Under that coldness, even Xiao Yan could not help but involuntarily shiver. After which, he once again cross his legs and sat on the ground. While the chillness was still dense, he entered his training state.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Yan entered his training mode, the surrounding fire affinity energy immediately appeared to have been dragged as it surged toward Xiao Yan in all directions. This time around, the bright-red substance-like energy would collide against the cold liquid that covered his body before it could make contact. The heat and coldness collided with each other, and the medicinal strength that was contained within the coldness swiftly resolved the wild violence within the hot energy. After which, a large amount of purified energy poured into Xiao Yan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind looked at the hot energy that entered like a swarm. He sensed the weakened violence within; it was difficult to detect. Only then did he nod his head with satisfaction. After which, he controlled this enormous fire affinity energy and slowly circulated it through the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 path. Finally, it was transformed into waves of powerful, pure Dou Qi that merged into Xiao Yan\u2019s body container that had been expanded greatly yesterday\u2026</p><br/><p>The density of the fire affinity energy within the magma world gave Xiao Yan a nice surprise. Moreover, the wild violence within the energy was resolved by the cold liquid and he could absorb the energy without any fear. According to this speed, Xiao Yan had the confidence that he would once again breakthrough to become a six star Dou Huang within three months!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s first training within the magma world did not last for long. Around an hour or so later, Xiao Yan\u2019s tightly shut eyes were slowly opened. Some fiery heat flashed through his dark-black eyes. A mouthful of hot air followed his throat before slowly being scattered.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tightened his fist slightly and sensed the filled feeling within his body. The corner of his mouth was involuntarily lifted into a faint smile. This place was indeed extremely suitable for him. He had merely trained for less than an hour but he could vaguely sense the Dou Qi within his cells advancing. If this were to continue for a prolonged period of time, his advancement would definitely be quite frightening. However, the only flaw was that the atmosphere in this place was really too quiet. If he wanted to train for a long period of time, he had to be prepared for loneliness\u2026</p><br/><p>Training was originally an extremely bitter matter. If one wanted to obtain a strength that an ordinary person had difficulty matching, one must put in an effort that others had difficulty reaching. There would never be strength that came for no reason in this world. This point was something that Xiao Yan, who experienced many things, had long learned. Hence, even though he knew that training in this place was extremely tough, he still choose to do it without hesitation\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan finally began to practice the \u2018Six Joint Body Flowing Ruler\u2019 after familiarizing with the magma world for an entire day. The environment in this place was really perfect when it was used for training.</p><br/><p>The initial training was naturally the hardest. Since the \u2018Six Joint Body Flowing Ruler\u2019 was of a high class,it was difficult to practice. However, it was fortunate that Xiao Yan\u2019s training talent was unique. Additionally, he had the spiritual imprint within the scroll to teach him, allowing him to save quite a number of detours in his training. Hence, after bitterly training for a couple of days in the magma world and undergoing many dangers of the magma touching his body, he had gradually gained a simple understanding. He was already able to reach this stage when he displayed it. Although there was still a large distance to successfully mastering it, being able to reach such a level within a short few days was already extremely good. As long as Xiao Yan was given sufficient time, an initial mastery of the \u2018Six Joint Body Flowing Ruler\u2019 was not an impossible matter\u2026</p><br/><p>The deathly quiet magma world was void of any concept of time. However, Xiao Yan also knew that it had been around ten days since he had entered this place. He had gained quite a lot during these ten days. Not only had his strength been firmly stabilized at the five star Dou Huang level, but he was even more familiar with the \u2018Six Joint Body Flowing Ruler.\u2019 Moreover, following this period of adaptation, Xiao Yan also became more and more comfortable with this magma world\u2026</p><br/><p>After this adaptation, the mysterious summoning feeling that Xiao Yan had faintly sensed when he had arrived once again appeared. This time around, his senses were even clearer. After a careful investigation, he was surprised to realize that the summoning target\u2026 seemed to be the Fallen Heart Flame in his body?</p><br/>\n</div>"}
