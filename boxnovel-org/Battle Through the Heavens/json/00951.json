The solemn atmosphere from earlier completely vanished. Everyone was busy talking about the scene that had occurred earlier. The frightening strength that the mysterious expert had displayed was shocking to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, The fleeing manner of that bastard snake Xia Mang earlier was just like a foolish snake that had been beaten unconscious. It was really enjoyable. Although we were nearly finished off, being able to see that demon snake Xia Mang, with his fierce reputation, being turned into such a miserable manner made it worthwhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is because of the great strength of that elder. From what Xia Mang said, that elder should be an alchemist. According to my guess, he should at least be a tier 6 alchemist. Otherwise, it is extremely difficult for him to rely on his Spiritual Strength to frighten off Xia Mang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, a tier 6 alchemist. I recall that the chief alchemist in our Han clan is only a tier 5 alchemist, no? Even though that is the case, the clan head is still very courteous when meeting him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, we can be considered lucky this time around. Unfortunately, we did not get to see that elder. A tier 6 alchemist. That is a top existence even in the Tian Bei City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop daydreaming. An expert naturally has the pride of an expert. We should already kowtow and thank him for rescuing us in passing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sat in the carriage and involuntarily laughed when he heard the heated discussions outside. It was fortunate that he did not show himself earlier\u2026</p><br/><p>The curtain of the carriage was suddenly opened while Xiao Yan was quietly sighing. Immediately, a smiling Han Chong strode in. He randomly threw a water bag to the former and smiled as he asked, \u201cYou were not shocked, were you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received the water bag, drank a mouthful of water before he nodded with a grin. He softly replied, \u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, we were lucky this time around to meet an elder who helped us. Otherwise, it is likely that we would have been killed in the Ten Thousand Snake Gorge.\u201d Han Chong sat in the carriage and joyously said, \u201cHowever, that elder is really quite nice. Normally, there is seldom anyone who would bother in the matter of others unless they were acquainted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grinned. It seemed that Han Chong in front of him had suffered deep shock within the gorge. Now, he was exhaling all of it in one go. Moreover, the unceasing praises he had for that mysterious \u2018elder,\u2019 who had intervened, caused Xiao Yan\u2019s expression to become somewhat strange as he nodded.</p><br/><p>After speaking in a long-winded manner for over ten minutes, Han Chong finally stopped in a manner that suggested he had yet to say enough. He smiled at Xiao Yan and said, \u201cAfter passing through the Ten Thousand Snake Gorge, the remaining journey will be uneventful. Although there might be some bandits and displaced people along the way, they are not a threat to us. Originally, we would not have passed through the Ten Thousand Snake Gorge during this journey. However, we met with a sandstorm in the desert and ended up deviating from our path. If we were to head back, it would have required an extremely long time. Hence, we can only brace ourselves and take this route.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Han, how much longer will it take from this place to Tian Bei city?\u201d Xiao Yan came to a sudden understanding. He was still uncertain about why Han Xue\u2019s group was not received by experts dispatched by the Han clan despite knowing that they needed to pass through the Ten Thousand Snake Gorge along the way. After hearing this, he understood that they had changed routes. He nodded his head, hesitated for a moment, and eventually posed his question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf everything is smooth, there is still around another six days.\u201d Han Chong thought for a moment before replying.</p><br/><p>\u201cSix days huh\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan softly muttered when he heard this. His heart immediately let out a quiet sigh of relief. His injuries should be mostly recovered within six days. There would definitely be quite a number of experts when they reached that city. If he did not recover his strength quickly, it was likely that he would be faced with a lot of trouble. After all, regardless of where one was located, one would only have the right to speak and ability to protect oneself only if one possessed strength.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan planned to begin gathering information about the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 once he reached Tian Bei City. If it was possible, he would head to the Burning Flame Valley and obtain the remaining two changes of the Sky Fire Three Mysterious Change. Once he possessed both of these changes, he should be able to contend with an elite Dou Zong head-on even if he did not use the Angry Buddha Lotus Flame.</p><br/><p>Han Chong was completely unaware of the thoughts within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. Hence, after chatting for a moment, he instructed Xiao Yan to recuperate properly before he descended from the carriage.</p><br/><p>The convoy followed the main road and headed south, slowly progressing toward Tian Bei City, which was some distance away. Due to everyone being aware that Xiao Yan was seriously injured, seldom anyone disturbed him after Han Chong left. This gave him the time to quietly recuperate.</p><br/><p>The bumpiness of the carriage also continued for a period of time before slowly coming to a stop. Xiao Yan opened his eyes within the carriage, glanced at the sky, and knew that the convoy was about to begin setting up camp again. Traveling at night in this desert was quite dangerous, and it would be extremely inefficient. Hence, there was seldom anyone who would journey at night.</p><br/><p>After an afternoon\u2019s recuperation, the intense pain within Xiao Yan\u2019s body greatly weakened. He was even able to sense some Dou Qi flowing within his veins. Although it was extremely tiny when compared to the past, the speed at which his injuries were recovering caused him to feel quite happy.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pulled open the curtain of the carriage and walked down after the carriage came to a stop. He knew Han Xue\u2019s character and did not wish to be reprimanded by her again.</p><br/><p>Once he descended from the carriage, Xiao Yan grabbed some tent poles, and walked over to the tent spot Han Chong\u2019s group had selected. However, he would sniff a faint serene fragrance being transmitted in front of him each time he took a couple of steps forward. He immediately paused, raised his head, and looked at Han Xue in front. After which, he smiled at her and nodded.</p><br/><p>Han Xue stood prettily on some rock fragments. Her pretty eyes stared at the young man in front of her. His rough linen clothes gave him an additional ordinariness. His face was considered quite young and delicate, but it could not be considered handsome. Nevertheless, it was a face that one could continue watching. He seemed to belong to the the kind of man who appeared more interesting the longer one looked at him. Han Xue\u2019s pretty eyes studied the other party\u2019s eyes only for her to be slightly startled. Those dark-black eyes did not reveal an uneasiness nor fleetingness that others displayed when watching her. All that was visible within them was a slight smile and calmness. The eyes were just like deep water that had difficulty forming even the slightest ripple.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Han Xue, is there anything?\u201d When Han Xue\u2019s pretty eyes were staring at Xiao Yan, he began to be unable to endure this attention of hers. He took the lead to open his mouth and inquire with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>Han Xue\u2019s eyebrows trembled slightly when she heard this. She immediately extended her hand slowly and grabbed Xiao Yan\u2019s arm amid some stunned gazes around them. Probing Dou Qi was swiftly transmitted into Xiao Yan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression did not change even a little as he sensed the Dou Qi enter his body. A thought passed through his mind and the Dou Qi within his body immediately scattered into his veins.</p><br/><p>The Dou Qi circulated one round around Xiao Yan\u2019s body before helplessly returning. It used the same route as it traveled back into Han Xue\u2019s body. Only then did she release her hand. Disappointment flashed across her eyes. It seemed that her little ridiculous guess did indeed originate from nowhere. Currently, the only thing that she had discovered within Xiao Yan\u2019s body was his extremely serious internal injuries\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Han Xue shook her head. She glanced at the tent poles he was carrying on his shoulders and said, \u201cThe internal injuries within your body are quite serious. There is no need for you to work. Let other people do these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, there is no need to. Although I am injured, I am not some useless person.\u201d Xiao Yan heartily laughed. He shook his head before continuing to carry the tent poles. He sidestepped Han Xue and walked toward Han Chong\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>Han Xue involuntarily mocked herself as she turned her head and studied the somewhat skinny back. She actually had that kind of unrealistic thought. Looking at Xiao Yan\u2019s appearance, his age was likely similar to hers. Even if he was some training genius, it was likely that he would have difficulty reaching the point of frightening off an elite Dou Huang with just two words at such an age.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it was really just a case of good luck\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The desert night was still cold and desolate. A faint silver glow covered the vast land where one could not see the borders even when standing on high ground.</p><br/><p>The interior of the camp was quiet. Only the occasional crackling of the flame could be heard. There were quite a number of sentries walking back and forth outside of the camp, protecting it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was seated cross-legged in a somewhat simple tent in the camp. His body was once again covered with that medicinal liquid he used during training. Threads of energy surged from Xiao Yan\u2019s surroundings before following his breath as they poured into his body.</p><br/><p>The Dou Qi within Xiao Yan\u2019s body was increasing a little at a time. The feeling of possessing strength gradually returned to Xiao Yan\u2019s powerless body.</p><br/><p>This training continued for a long time. Only when a thread of morning sunlight reached the sky of the desert did Xiao Yan slowly open his eyes. However, there was a shock that was difficult to hide within Xiao Yan\u2019s opened eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly widened his hands. A jade-green Dou Qi slowly surged out as his gaze stared intently at this cluster of Dou Qi. He could vaguely see a faint-silver-colored energy\u2026 that appeared to be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSpatial Strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. Surprise gradually surfaced in his eyes. Spatial Strength was a mysterious strength that one needed to reach the Dou Zong class in order to be barely able to control. Before reaching that class, even an expert at the peak of the Dou Huang class did not possess the qualification to control it. However, the thread of silver-colored energy that had appeared within Xiao Yan\u2019s Dou Qi was genuine Spatial Strength!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Spatial Strength seems to have been left behind when the Spatial Strength within the space tunnel was destroyed. After which, for some reason, it was not scattered. Instead, it merged with my Dou Qi\u2026 it is really the case of a blessing because of a disaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mused for a moment before softly muttering.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, regardless of what the reason\u2026 the current me seems to possess a little ability to control Spatial Strength. Although it is extremely weak, I am really in possession of it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth slowly lifted into a smile. A hand was extended out before he suddenly clenched it. When it was clenched, the space in front of him actually formed a slight distortion!</p><br/>\n</div>"}
