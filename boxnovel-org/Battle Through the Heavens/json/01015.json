Under his effort to expel the poison, Jin Shi\u2019s spirit was getting better everyday. Hence, his attitude to Xiao Yan gradually changed from the a treatment of someone equal to the current courteous and respectful one. Although Xiao Yan had just broken through to the Dou Zong class not long ago, his other status as an alchemist was sufficient to cause a person at Jin Shi\u2019s level to treat him politely. After all, everyone knew what a lucky thing it was to be able to befriend a high tier alchemist.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s remaining effort during these couple of days was spent on the Demon Poison Spot within his body. Everyday that this time-bomb-like thing, which had pestered him for a few years, was not removed, it would stay a thorn within his heart that would cause him to always feel a little uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Through his study during this period of time, Xiao Yan had also gained a much deeper understanding of the Demon Poison Spot. However, he did not recklessly do anything. This Demon Poison Spot was extremely frightening. If the Little Fairy Doctor had not placed a seal on it back then, it was likely that it would have long since erupted. Xiao Yan might have already broken through to the Dou Zong class, but it was best if he did not take the initiative to remove the seal. It would not be too late for him to act when he had more confidence.</p><br/><p>.....</p><br/><p>A fire was burning fiercely within the wooden basin of a rock house permeated by hot air. Only the middle spot of the house was void of hot air. That place was where Jin Shi\u2019s head was protruding from the medicinal water.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Jin Shi appeared extremely energetic. Both his aura and his liveliness were far from what his previous sickly-self could compare with. Clearly, the expelling of the poison by Xiao Yan during this period of time was quite effective.</p><br/><p>The fog permeated the place for a long time before it slowly thinned. The medicinal water within the wooden basin had also become clear. The medicinal liquid within it had already entered Jin Shi\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and returned the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame to his body. He also sighed in relief. It was fortunate that he had currently reached the Dou Zong class. Otherwise, with his previous strength, it would have been difficult for him to perform such a long period of poison expelling in such a relaxed manner.</p><br/><p>Jin Shi leaped out of the wooden basin after having put on his clothes. He sensed the lifeforce that seeped out of his body and a joy surfaced on his old face. He cupped his hands and solemnly said to Xiao Yan, \u201cLittle brother Xiao Yan, a simple thanks does not do such a big favor justice. The old me shall remember this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grinned. He took out two jade bottles from his Storage Ring and handed them to Jin Shi. He uttered, \u201cI will leave tomorrow. This is the medicinal liquid and medicinal pill needed to expel the poison. Most of the fire poison within your body has already been expelled. Hence, there is no longer a need for me to use the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 as a catalyst. You should have already learned the poison expelling method during this period of time. Hence, I shall not say anything more about it. If you follow the method, the fire poison in your body will be completely removed within two to three months.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are leaving tomorrow?\u201d Jin Shi was startled upon hearing this. He hurriedly confirmed what had been said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. The so-called Four Pavilions Grand Meeting was likely to begin. If he wished to find Feng zun-zhe, he could only head to the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Otherwise, those elite Dou Zuns were all so elusive. He did not know just when he would be able to find the other party again. Due to the \u2018Hall of Souls,\u2019 Xiao Yan was unable to openly speak about the matter. He could only quietly search by himself.</p><br/><p>Jin Shi could only nod his head when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s insistence. He received the two jade bottle and said in a deep voice, \u201cLittle brother Xiao Yan, if you meet with any trouble in the future, you can come and find me in the Heaven Eye Mountain Range. Even that old fellow Fei Tian would not dare to do anything to you in this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. Although Jin Shi was a Magical Beast, he valued relationships. The strength of the Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe was weak when compared to the Wind Lightning Pavilion. However, he was still able to say such words. From the looks of it, he was a worthy person to befriend.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I shall thank elder Jin Shi first.\u201d</p><br/><p>......</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was seated cross-legged on a bed within a room that was filled with a gentle light. His upper body was naked. There was a dark-black ink-like spot on his chest, which was vaguely emitting a stench. Surrounding the black spot were some unusual symbols. They wrapped around the countless number of black lines spreading from the black spot. These symbols were the seal that Little Fairy Doctor had placed on him. However, the symbols had become a lot paler after the erosion of the Demon Poison Spot during these few years. It seemed that it would not be able to hold out for long.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes paused on the black spot. There were two methods if one wished to remove this Demon Poison Spot. One was to find a Dou Zun class expert to help him while the other was to find another \u2018Heavenly Flame.\u2019 After the three kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 merged, it would be an easy matter to refine this Demon Poison Spot. Unfortunately, the current Xiao Yan did not meet either of the requirements.</p><br/><p>Although he had not met both conditions, Xiao Yan vaguely sensed that his current self was no longer as helpless against this Demon Poison Spot as he was back then. His breakthrough this time around was a great benefit to him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned and thought deeply for awhile. After which, he suddenly clenched his teeth. A thought passed through his mind and the jade-green flame swiftly moved within his body. It quickly gathered at his chest and surrounded the Demon Poison Spot.</p><br/><p>Looking at the pale seal, it was obvious that it would not be able to endure for long. Hence, Xiao Yan must quickly settle this Demon Poison Spot. Although it was somewhat difficult for him to refine the Demon Poison Spot in one go with his current strength, he could choose to do it over a prolonged period, gradually refining it. Hence, he could reduce the pressure felt by the seal.</p><br/><p>After having made up his mind, Xiao Yan\u2019s mind controlled a thread of flame that sprang out. It came to the Demon Poison Spot and coiled around it. After which, it suddenly pounced forward.</p><br/><p>The flame collided with the circular symbol seal. Its high temperature immediately caused the seal to emit a white smoke and \u2018chi chi\u2019 sound. Following the erosion of the \u2018Heavenly Flame,\u2019 the complete seal gradually began to break open, forming a small gap in the process.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan controlled the flame perfectly. The small gap was insufficient to cause the Demon Poison Spot to erupt, but it was also able to drag a small portion out.</p><br/><p>The crack had just been formed when the Demon Poison Spot within it, which had been quiet for many years, suddenly began to surge. The black cluster wiggled and a thumb-sized, black line separated from the body before rushing to the gap.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind tensed up when he saw that black line shoot out. The jade-green flame around the seal became turbulent, like a sea of fire, as it surrounded the area around his chest until nothing could seep out.</p><br/><p>The black line successfully penetrated through the gap and a dense wave of fishy stench spread out. This fishy stench contained an extremely corrosive strength. However, it was fortunate that Xiao Yan had the protection of the \u2018Heavenly Flame.\u2019 The moment these fishy stench appeared, it immediately emitted a \u2018chi chi\u2019 sound and swiftly turned into nothing.</p><br/><p>A coldness also flashed through Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes as he looked at the dark-black, somewhat sinister line. If he had yet to breakthrough to the Dou Zong class at this moment, it was likely that this Demon Poison Spot black line would have turned his body into a complete mess. Fortunately, the current him had truly reached the Dou Zong class.</p><br/><p>A thought passed through Xiao Yan\u2019s mind and the jade-green sea of flames around his chest immediately transformed into numerous fire dragons. These dragons were accompanied by a low, deep roar as they surged toward the black line.</p><br/><p>The Demon Poison Spot black string seemed to display an uneasiness when it faced such a large scale encirclement by the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame. With the growth of Xiao Yan\u2019s strength, the power of this Glazed Lotus Heart Flame had also soared. Back then, just refining a tiny Demon Poison Spot black line had exhausted a long period of time. If Xiao Yan were to do it again at this moment, he had the confidence that the refinement speed would decrease by at least ten times the amount of time it took before.</p><br/><p>While the thread of the Demon Poison Spot was feeling uncertain, the fire dragon instantly arrived. The flame swept over and surrounded the black line. After which, the flames twisted together, transforming into a cluster of fierce green flame that wrapped the black line and swiftly began to refine it.</p><br/><p>Faced with the refinement of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, the Demon Poison Spot black line also began to resist. Waves of corrosive fog unceasingly surged into his body. After which, the fog collided with the surrounding flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi Chi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The black fog collided onto the flame and a \u2018chi chi\u2019 sound immediately erupted. The current Glazed Lotus Heart Flame might have difficulty completely refining the Demon Poison Spot, but it did not have a problem refining this small portion of it.</p><br/><p>Under the control of Xiao Yan\u2019s mind, the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 swiftly shrank. A \u2018chi chi\u2019 sound once again appeared. Immediately, one could see the Demon Poison Spot black line swiftly paling. Within an hour or so, the black-colored poison within it was completely refined by the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame.</p><br/><p>After the poison within was removed, an extremely pure, substance-like Dou Qi appeared in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>This cluster of Dou Qi did not possess the slightest consciousness. It simply remained within the flame without moving.</p><br/><p>A satisfied expression surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s face when he sensed the purity of this Dou Qi. This Demon Poison Spot might be dangerous, but it could be considered a great tonic. If he completely refined it, Xiao Yan estimated that his strength could at least leap to the level of a three star Dou Zong.</p><br/><p>Danger and reward indeed coexisted in everything in this world.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind controlled this wave of Dou Qi, and directed it along the route of the Flame Mantra, immediately making it his own.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart laughed when he sensed the tiny increase of strengthened Dou Qi within his body. His mind once again reached into the Demon Poison Spot. After which, he continued to drag a small amount of Demon Poison Spot poison from it\u2026</p><br/><p>Although he could not refine the Demon Poison Spot in one go, all he needed to do was to remove a little of it to refine each time. Over time, this Demon Poison Spot would naturally collapse because it lacked Dou Qi. At that time, the time bomb in his body would also automatically disappear\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe effect of this thing is something that even some tier 7 medicinal pills cannot compare with. Hee hee, that old fellow Xie Bi Yan has really given me a great gift\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}
