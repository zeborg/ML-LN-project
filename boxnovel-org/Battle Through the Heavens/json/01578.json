There was a little resistance being vaguely emitted. After all, the two types of Heavenly Flames already had their respective owners. Even though their owners did not resist, their instincts would still pose some resistance. Moreover, this was the case despite Xiao Yan having transformed into possessing a Heavenly Flame constitution. If an ordinary person was to hold them, it was likely that they would have already exploded instead of acting in such a docile manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned slightly as he detected the slight resistance being emitted from the two clusters of essence flames. He flicked his finger. A wisp of pink flame was extended from his finger. After which, it wrapped the two clusters of essence Heavenly Flames. Immediately, the fire glow around the two clusters of Heavenly Flames showed a slight sign of stiffening. Even though these two Heavenly Flames did not possess any intelligence, they were still being frightened to the point of not daring to move in the face of the frightening Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame\u2019s purifying strength.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief within his heart after seeing the two clusters of essence Heavenly Flames becoming quiet. He curled his hand and six flames were once again formed. Xiao Yan flicked his finger while these six flames were slowly merging. The Life Spirit Flame and Turtle Spiritual Earth Flame were shot into them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The flame, which was quietly being gathered, emitted a low and deep sound following the entry of these two Heavenly Flames. Waves after waves of frightening energy wildly whistled from within. It actually showed a vague sign of being about to explode.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression became a little grave as he sensed the change within the flame. Even though he currently possessed the Heavenly Flame spirit constitution of Little Yi, he was indeed a little too unfamiliar with these two Heavenly Flames. There was naturally some difficulty in merging them. However, this did not cause Xiao Yan to panic. His perfect Heavenly State Spiritual Strength poured into the flame like floodwater. Immediately, the wild and violent nature within became like a large tank of cold water being added to boiling water. It immediately became quiet.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the wild violence scattered. The fire once again agglomerated under Xiao yan\u2019s control. At the same time, the Dou Qi within Xiao Yan\u2019s body continuously surged into the flame like floodwater. The addition of two types of Heavenly Flames had increased Xiao Yan\u2019s Dou Qi exhaustion many times over. An exhaustion of that extent was something that even the current Xiao Yan had difficulty supporting.</p><br/><p>With an increasing amount of Dou Qi being poured into the flame, layers after layers of seemingly real ripples began to be formed within it. A partial lotus shape was had vaguely appeared with the flame. A kind of fluctuation that frightened even Xiao Yan, quietly spread from it.</p><br/><p>The might of an Angry Buddha Lotus Flame being formed from eight types of Heavenly Flames could really be described as having the ability to destroy the world!</p><br/><p>Hun Yan, who had been held back by the fearless Northern King, had also detected the frightening fluctuation as it spread. His expression finally experienced a change as he looked at Xiao Yan in a grave manner. Those eyes of his were focused on the eight coloured flame on Xiao Yan\u2019s hands. His eyes involuntarily twitched. Even he could sense a danger from that force\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat is indeed extremely strange. He is merely a five star Dou Sheng, yet he is able to unleash such a frightening attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold glint flashed within Hun Yan\u2019s eyes. He suddenly slammed his palm onto the body of the Northern King. The sudden increase in his strength directly caused the chest of the Northern King to sink a little. If it was not because it was a puppet, this palm would have already taken his life. Even though this was the case, that ferocious palm wind still caused the Northern King to fly back by a thousand feet. After which, Hun Yan\u2019s body moved and directly pounced onto Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s expression changed upon seeing this. He let out a cold cry and a Dou Qi pillar shot out. However, such an attack was completely ignored by Hun Yan. It was scattered with the wave of his sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cRed Poison Palm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Man Shen Nong had a grave expression after seeing that the obstruction was futile. His body rushed forward and his hand swiftly swelled. It also turned bright red in colour. An unusual phenomenon was vaguely emitted from it as it smashed towards Hun Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Faced with Old Man Shen Nong, Hun Yan could only let out a cold snort. He flipped and lifted his hand. Those five fingers became charred black. He randomly slammed his hand forward and collided with the bright red palm wind of Old Man Shen Nong.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>The collision between the two emitted an unusual fragrance. Immediately, Old Man Shen Nong\u2019s expression paled. A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out. His body also miserably fly backwards. Clearly, he had suffered a big loss upon contact.</p><br/><p>\u201cA group of little shrimps actually dares to try and escape from the hands of my Hun clan. In your dreams!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Yan laughed coldly after he defeated Old Man Shen Nong with a strike from his palm. His body flashed and he appeared in front of Xiao Yan. His black fingers were just like the fingers of a death god as they grabbed towards Xiao Yan with lightning like speed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes stared intently at Hun Yan\u2019s claw wind. The latter would land on his body in an instant. The sharp wind easily tore through the Dou Qi defence on Xiao Yan\u2019s body. After which, it heavily landed on his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThud thud!\u201d</p><br/><p>The black fingers cut across, bringing with it some blood and sparks. The clothes in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s chest had directly turned into dust. A layer of tough dragon scale covered his body. However, five deep wounds had already appeared on the dragon scale at this moment. Fresh blood continued to flow out from his wound. If it was not because of the protection from the Dragon Phoenix Ancient Armour, it was likely that Xiao Yan\u2019s stomach would have been torn apart by this strike.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face turned pale after suffering this heavy blow. Hun Yan\u2019s claw wind had directly sent him flying backwards. However, an icy cold smile flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes as he flew backwards. His mouth widened slightly, \u201cExplode!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly shrunk after the soft voice was emitted. His sight stilled at the spot a couple of centimetres from him. There was a palm sized fire lotus slowly rotating there. A brilliant eight coloured fire lotus was rotating at that spot. It appeared incomparably beautiful.</p><br/><p>Hun Yan\u2019s expression changed drastically as he looked at the fire lotus, which was in close proximity. Before he could react, however, a bright luster had erupted from within the fire lotus. Countless of light pillar containing an extermination force erupted. They shot out from the fire lotus in a densely packed manner. Any person struck by the fire lotus would be turned into ashes almost immediately. From the looks of it, it was fortunate that Xiao Yan had borrowed Hun Yan\u2019s strength and flew backwards. Otherwise, it was likely that he would be shot by these extermination light pillars.</p><br/><p>Hun Yan was the first to be struck. His body was penetrated by many light pillars. However, it did not turn into dust at this moment. Monstrous Dou Qi continued to surge from within his body as it tried its best to block the erosion of the extermination force.</p><br/><p>However, the fire lotus, which had been merged from eight types of Heavenly Flames, was not simple. An extermination like fire lotus was emitted from within the fire lotus after the light pillar shot out. The bright light in the sky appeared just like a bright sun. Intense piercing light had basically covered the entire Yao Realm\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>An indescribable extermination like force swept in all directions across the sky. The mountain range below, which was already full of holes, had turned into a red ground. The terrifyingly high temperature had melted the entire mountain range.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grabbed Yao Lao and the others. Their bodies flew backwards as the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame formed a huge fire barrier in front of them. Only then did the group avoided getting implicated by the attack.</p><br/><p>The extermination force lasted for quite a long time before it gradually faded. A black smoke fell from the middle. Finally, it violently landed below, smashing the ground and forming a ten thousand feet large pit. Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes looked into the distance. He could vaguely see Hun Yan within it. The latter was wrapped in a black vapour. However, his aura had become a lot weaker than before. Clearly, he had at the very least been seriously injured.</p><br/><p>Old Man Shen Nong by the side inhaled a breath of cold air. His eyes were filled with shock as he watched this scene. It was difficult for him to imagine that Xiao Yan was actually able to force an advance seven star Dou Sheng until such an extent\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry and leave, the space at that spot had already been torn apart by the remanent force!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face was pale. The piercing pain transmitted from his chest caused his body to tremble. He swung his hand and tossed the Life Spirit Flame and Turtle Spiritual Earth Flame towards Old Man Shen Nong and Yao Tian as he cried out in an anxious voice. His current condition was also extremely terrible. An eight coloured fire lotus\u2019 exhaustion was far more terrifying as compared to what he had imagined. Even his current self could only use it once. However, he would end up being unusually weak. A weakened person had almost no chance of surviving in this situation with danger lurking all around.</p><br/><p>Only after hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words did everyone realised that the middle ripples from the extermination force had actually been torn apart, forming a spatial crack line that was a couple of dozen feet in size. They immediately braced their attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan took out a jade bottle from his Storage Ring. He randomly poured the medicinal liquid inside onto the injuries on his chest and once again urged. Taking the lead, he extended the bone wings on his back and rushed into the spatial crack with lightning like speed. Now was the best opportunity to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Yan\u2019s body swayed as he rose from the ground. His expression was ferocious as he roared. It was unexpected that even with his strength, he had actually been forced into such a miserable state by Xiao Yan!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang!</p><br/><p>All the remaining experts from the Yao clan actually began to crazily self-destruct after seemingly having sensed that there was hope for Xiao Yan\u2019s group to escape. The waves from the explosions completely blocked those experts from the Hun clan, who wanted to free themselves to stop Xiao Yan\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>Hun Jing, who was exchanging blows with Yao Dan, had a gloomy face upon seeing this scene. Unexpectedly, that brat was even able to force back Hun Yan. However, Yao Dan appeared to be aware of his intentions just as he was planning to free himself to block the group. A crazy and ferocious smile surfaced on Yao Dan\u2019s face. After which, the Dou Qi within his body suddenly became wild and violent\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, thank you very much\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Dan turned his head as the Dou Qi within his body reached the limit of its untamed violence. He looked at Xiao Yan, who had grabbed Yao Tian, Yao Ling and the rest as he entered the spatial crack. Those crazy scarlet eyes of Yao Dan revealed a smile that seemed to have been relieved of a great burden. After which, an extermination explosion that was not weaker than the eight coloured fire lotus explosion from earlier once again resounded within this blood covered realm!</p><br/>\n</div>"}
