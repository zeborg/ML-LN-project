That heavy feeling nearly caused the rock platform to shake.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air as he looked at the medicinal cauldron in front of him. He opened his mouth and a cluster of jade-green flames was spat out. With a flick of his finger, the flame carried a beautiful tail that barged into the medicinal cauldron. It immediately erupted once inside. Fierce flames repeatedly churned within the medicinal cauldron. The increasing temperature caused this\u2026 place to gradually grow hotter.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeves as the flame rose. Medicinal ingredients immediately began to drift out of his Storage Ring one after another. They surfaced in the air above the rock platform under the cover of his Dou Qi. They appeared like tiny light clusters that seemed very beautiful when looked at from below.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven Soul Blood Bone Pill, tier 7 medicinal pill. It has the shocking miraculous effect of improving one\u2019s constitution and raising one\u2019s training talent. The ingredients needed to refine it are extremely troublesome. There are around seventy-seven of them with four main ingredients. The four are Dragon Blood Ganoderma, Bone Spirit Fruit, Mysterious Sky Green Vine, and the essence blood of a rank 7 or higher Magical Beast. Each of these four ingredients are extremely rare and precious things. It was quite difficult to find them. Moreover, the refining method is harsh and requires one to pay special attention\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The method to refine the Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill slowly surfaced within Xiao Yan\u2019s mind. Some of the critical parameters were also imprinted into Xiao Yan\u2019s mind without a single word missing.</p><br/><p>Seventy-seven refining ingredients. It was the first time that Xiao Yan had seen a pill that required such a number of medicinal ingredients. Even the ingredients needed for the Ground Spirit Pill that Yao Lao had refined for the purpose of subduing the Fallen Heart Flame did not reach this number. From it, one could tell that this Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill was extremely difficult to refine. It likely even exceeded the difficulty of the Ground Spirit Pill\u2026</p><br/><p>These confused thoughts flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s heart only to be expelled by him moments later. He raised his head, sensed the temperature within the medicinal cauldron, and nodded. His finger beckoned and one could see the fiercely burning jade-green flame within the medicinal cauldron immediately began to weakened.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stared intently into the medicinal cauldron. A moment later, he moved his finger and a glow flashed over. It immediately transformed into a blood-red-colored Ganoderma that landed in his hand.</p><br/><p>This Ganoderma (Lingzhi) had just appeared when it began to emit waves of a bloody scent. One could even vaguely sense a ripple of pure energy within the bloodiness.</p><br/><p>This was one of the key ingredients used to refine the Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill, the Dragon Blood Ganoderma. Although this kind of Ganoderma was not really tainted with dragon blood, it was extremely difficult to form. It needed to absorb the fresh blood of at least three kinds of snake-shaped Magical Beasts in order to break out of the ground and live.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s finger gently caressed the surface of the Dragon Blood Ganoderma. He sensed the somewhat pure energy contained within it. After exhaling gently, Xiao Yan flicked his finger and the Demon Blood Ganoderma turned into a red glow that was thrown into the medicinal cauldron.</p><br/><p>With the entrance of the Dragon Blood Ganoderma, the hibernating jade-green flame within the medicinal cauldron immediately surged out like a hungry wolf and swallowed it whole\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s ten fingers were all flicked the instant the flame swallowed the Dragon Blood Ganoderma. One could watch as the many light spots suspended in the air immediately divided themselves into strings of ten. They were immediately thrown into the medicinal cauldron before they began to charge into the flame without hesitation, one after the other\u2026</p><br/><p>The Dragon Blood Ganoderma had cold properties. It would be destroyed upon contact with fire. If one wanted to refine the medicinal liquid within it, one would have to use the dark chillness within the other medicinal items. Those ingredients that had been thrown into the medicinal cauldron earlier were the neutralizing items that had been prepared\u2026</p><br/><p>Refining so many medicinal ingredients at the same time was harsh on one\u2019s Spiritual Strength. However, it was fortunate that the current Xiao Yan already possessed the qualification and strength to attempt this.</p><br/><p>The many medicinal ingredients that had charged into the flame began to swiftly wither within a couple of breaths of coming into contact with the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame. Finally, the actual bodies transformed into powder. Droplets of pure medicinal liquid began to drip down. Finally, they merged under Xiao Yan Spiritual Strength\u2019s precise control. After which, they uniformly landed on the shriveling Dragon Blood Ganoderma\u2026</p><br/><p>The drops of the medicinal liquids started to slowly fade the blood-red color of the Dragon Blood Ganoderma. Its blood-colored skin was peeled off piece by piece. This continued for merely a moment before the color of the Dragon Blood Ganoderma become a pale-white color.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not pay too much attention to this Dragon Blood Ganoderma that had turned pale white. The genuine essence of the Dragon Blood Ganoderma was not within its body, but in the blood-colored skin. That\u2019s what was needed to refine the Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill.</p><br/><p>The few drops of pale-white medicinal liquid fell on the blood-red skin, and the skin quietly melted under the constant temperature. A couple of minutes later, a fist-sized pool of a blood-colored liquid appeared within the medicinal cauldron.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan heaved a sigh of relief when his first refinement was successfully completed. He waved his hand and the flame wrapped around the liquid, slowly emitting a warmth that caused the blood-colored liquid to gradually shrink. The liquid\u2019s color also became richer\u2026</p><br/><p>This cluster of blood-colored liquid had already turned extremely viscous by the time it had shrunk to the size of a thumb. Seeing this, the corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth revealed a smile. With the beckoning of his hand, another light rushed over, transforming into a white-colored fruit with a surface that was full of potholes. This was the so-called Bone Spirit Fruit\u2026</p><br/><p>The refinement of the few key ingredients was extremely arduous. If one did not possess a special refinement method, it would be difficult to refine the portions that one needed. This was the case for the Dragon Blood Ganoderma, for the Bone Spirit Fruit, and for the Mysterious Sky Green Vine.</p><br/><p>The difficulty of the Bone Spirit Fruit\u2019s refinement was even greater. Xiao Yan used nearly twenty other ingredients to neutralize it along with an hour\u2019s time in order to successfully refine a white-colored drop of bone-like liquid.</p><br/><p>After the successful refinement of the Bone Spirit Fruit, Xiao Yan threw the Mysterious Sky Green Vine into the medicinal cauldron. This so-called Mysterious Sky Green Vine was extremely tough. It was neither wood nor gold. Moreover, the thing that really surprised one was its impressive fire resistance. Even though Xiao Yan had the help of the Glazed Lotus Core Flame, he spent a total of two hours in order to cause crack lines to appear on its surface.</p><br/><p>Over twenty light clusters flew into the medicinal cauldron the moment the Mysterious Sky Green Vine cracked apart. Finally, they were refined by Xiao Yan, transforming into droplets of pure energy that dripped onto the green vine\u2026</p><br/><p>Borrowing the neutralizing strength of these many medicinal ingredients, the Mysterious Sky Green Vine, that seemed to have shrivelled, finally split apart after around half an hour. A pale-green powder scattered out before solidifying into a green-colored powder ball by Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Strength.</p><br/><p>The three kinds of key ingredients were all successfully refined. Seeing this, Xiao Yan, along with Su Qian\u2019s group observing from a great distance, sighed in relief. The swift refining method of Xiao Yan dazzled their eyes. Although they did not really know much about refining medicinal pills, they were able to pick up on Xiao Yan\u2019s smooth refining method. This kind of refinement was really somewhat pleasing\u2026</p><br/><p>The waves of noise transmitted from the Inner Academy did not make it to Xiao Yan\u2019s ear. He rested for a moment after refining the three key ingredients before he once again refocused his attention. He mused for a moment and took out a jade bottle from his Storage Ring. The bottle\u2019s mouth was slowly tilted and a drop of green-red blood dripped out.</p><br/><p>The green-red blood glided in front of Xiao Yan. Although the blood was small in size, the wild and violent energy contained within it was not something that one dared to underestimate.</p><br/><p>This green-red blood was naturally refined from the mysterious Magical Beast dried corpse that he had obtained from the auction back then. The rank of the Magical Beast when it was alive was quite high. It had already far exceeded the requirements of the Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill. If it were to be used in the refinement and if the refinement were to succeed, the quality of the medicinal pill would likely be even greater.</p><br/><p>The many Elders in the sky also sensed something when this drop of green-red blood appeared. All of their faces immediately changed a little.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze stared intently at the drop of green-red blood. A moment later, he flicked his finger and the blood gently drifted away before entering the medicinal cauldron.</p><br/><p>The green-red liquid blood had just fallen into the medicinal cauldron when the powerful strength contained within it stirred waves of wild wind. Seeing this, Xiao Yan frowned, hesitated a little, and then immediately clenched his teeth. The medicinal liquid and medicinal powder that had been refined from the Dragon Blood Ganoderma, the Bone Spirit Fruit, and Mysterious Sky Green Vine were thrown in with the green-red blood!</p><br/><p>The three kinds of items, that contained extremely powerful energy, did not cause even a little surge when they landed in the green-red blood. Just when Xiao Yan\u2019s heart had just sighed in relief, however, a wild, violent energy ripple suddenly erupted from the green-red blood. It violently smashed against the medicinal cauldrons wall. A loud and clear sound wave swiftly spread, encompassing the entire Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>The thick medicinal cauldron trembled violently a couple of times at this moment. If it had been an ordinary medicinal cauldron, it was likely that this tremble would have caused it to burst apart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face was volatile as he looked at the surface of the green-red blood that was swiftly and repeatedly churning. At this moment, the sleek round surface of it had formed numerous long narrow thorns, causing it to look just like a tiny sea urchin. Within the churning sea urchin was an energy ripple that was so wild and violent words could not describe it.</p><br/><p>Clang! Clang!</p><br/><p>Numerous energy ripples repeatedly collided against the walls of the medicinal cauldron, and a loud sound repeatedly reverberated throughout the Inner Academy. At this moment, almost everyone was certain that there seemed to be a problem during the refinement.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, what do we do?\u201d An Elder softly inquired as he looked at the rock platform.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can we do? Refining a medicinal pill is different than fighting someone. How can we just help if we want to? Xiao Yan can only rely on himself during this kind of situation. Any random actions taken by others would just disturb him. Moreover, the refinement of a tier 7 medicinal pill has a low chance of success. Xiao Yan is currently still a tier 6 alchemist. Failing is an extremely common thing. There is no need to make a mountain out of a molehill.\u201d Su Qian frowned and spoke with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>That Elder could only bitterly smile and nod his head after being reprimanded by the First Elder.</p><br/><p>While the entire Inner Academy had turned into an uproar because of the repeated loud banging soind being emitted, Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze was staring firmly at the interior of the medicinal cauldron. His Spiritual Strength had completely poured out and densely covered every single corner of the medicinal cauldron\u2026</p><br/><p>He also knew that his chance of successfully refining a tier 7 medicinal pill was extremely low with his current alchemist skill. Even some tier 7 alchemist had difficulty successfully refining the medicinal pill on their first try\u2026</p><br/><p>With the small focal distance of Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze, his mind had become very focused. At a certain instant, the jade-green flame suddenly surged within his dark-black eyes. While the flame rose, Xiao Yan seemed to be able to vaguely see an intense battle between the energy corrosion and the merger with the green-red blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this is the reason\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A low mutter was slowly transmitted from Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth as he came to a sudden understanding.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
