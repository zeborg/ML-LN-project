It will enable you to recover your peak strength back then. Ke ke, however, please forgive me. Xiao Yan has owed you this medicinal pill for three years\u2026 three years can be long or short\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The figure suspended in the sky suddenly stiffened. It was a long while later before an excited expression swiftly spread across Hai Bodong\u2019s face. His hands trembled as he received the jade bottle and inhaled a deep breath of air. There was some moisture contained in those old eyes as he spoke in a hoarse voice, \u201cI have also waited three years for this day\u2026 to think that little fellow still remembered our agreement.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yun Du and Yun Sha were defeated, this enormous attack to exterminate the Primer clan had slowly ended with a situation that no one had expected under the focus of the eyes of many in the capital.</p><br/><p>In this fight, the Misty Cloud Sect, which had come charging forth in a menacing manner, had ended up suffering a wild blow. Not only were the nine experts completely defeated but over half of the ordinary disciples were killed or injured. Those who had remained alive were immediately locked up in the capital\u2019s prison. Hence, one could unceremoniously say that the Misty Cloud Sect had not only lost this attack but had lost quite miserably\u2026</p><br/><p>Only when the military from the capital began to clear up the streets, that had suffered quite a lot of damage, did those observers surrounding the Primer clan began to scatter with the remaining shock in their hearts and a feeling that they had not watched enough. One could imagine within a couple of days, the events that had happened in the capital would likely appeared to have grown wings as they swiftly spread to every single corner of the capital. Some of the neighboring empires might even receive this shocking news.</p><br/><p>The originally somewhat hopeless faces of the members of the Primer clan had also unloaded the heavy stones in their hearts following the end of this huge battle. Finally, they began to clear up the messy manor under the command of Ya Fei and some others.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan led Lin Yan and the others as they landed in the manor in front of the many respectful gazes below. Xiao Yan smiled at Xiao Ding who was seated on a wheelchair before immediately turned to his back and said, \u201cSecond brother, why are you not coming to see big brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee\u2026 hee hee\u2026\u201d Xiao Li smiled and stepped out from behind Xiao Yan after hearing this. The Dou Qi wings on his back slowly disappeared as he smiled and asked Xiao Ding, \u201cBig brother, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding smiled slightly as he looked at Xiao Li\u2019s face which was even thinner, darker and colder than it had been two years ago. Only then did he softly reply, \u201cIt has been hard on you these few years\u2026 Fortunately, you have remembered my words and did not let any trouble happen to third brother. Otherwise, you should not come back and look for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Li rubbed his head at the slight reprimand within Xiao Ding\u2019s words. However, he did not show the slightest displeasure or resistance.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, your leg?\u201d Xiao Li\u2019s gaze also paused on the wheelchair that Xiao Ding was sitting on. His expression suddenly sank as he anxiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026\u201d Xiao Ding randomly waved his hand. However, he spoke to Xiao Li with some surprise, \u201cInstead, you little fellow. Why is it that you have reached the Dou Wang class after having not met you for only two years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Li was startled when he heard this. He immediately spoke hurriedly, \u201cHee hee, hee hee, this is of course all thanks to third brother. Otherwise, with my talent, even if I were to train with all my might, I would at the very most be only a Dou Ling now.\u201d Xiao Li\u2019s hand was behind him giving Xiao Yan a hand signal while he was speaking.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was silent in his heart as he glanced at Xiao Li\u2019s hand signal. Second brother refusal to reveal the matters of him using his remaining life in exchange for strength was because he was afraid that big brother would worry. However, one might be able to keep such a thing a secret for a short period of time but not forever. According to the \u2018Life Devouring Pill\u2019s\u2019 overdraft on his life, it was likely that second brother would at the very most have half a year left to live\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I must think of a method to remove the trouble of second brother\u2019s \u2018Life Devouring Pill\u2019...\u201d Xiao Yan mused for a moment before he raised his head and shot his gaze toward Xiao Ding before smiling and nodding his head. After which, he lowered his body and pointed to Xiao Ding\u2019s thigh. He frowned and said, \u201cAre you poisoned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I was struck by a cold arrow covered with poison when I was fleeing back then. I have been delaying expelling the poison for these few years, which ended up causing me to lose the feeling of both my feet. However, I am used to it. At the very least, it allowed me to quietly think of things and train.\u201d Xiao Ding smiled. He did not appear too depressed over the crippling of both of his legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still some methods to expel the poison if it is only poisoned. However, too much time has passed and we can only take things slowly.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and sighed in relief within his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, even if we want to catch up with each other, we don\u2019t need to do this at the front door, right. Go, let\u2019s go in and talk. Although the Primer clan is now in a complete mess, it should still be able to provide a clean place.\u201d Hai Bodong by the side opened his mouth and laughed when he saw the three people who were conversing happily from the side.</p><br/><p>Everyone emitted kind laughter when they heard this. They immediately followed Hai Bodong and swarmed into the hall.</p><br/><p>Everyone swarmed into the hall before separating and moving to their seats. Lin Yan, Lin Xiuya, Liu Qing, and the others randomly sat beside Xiao Yan while those experts from \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 like Big Yao and the others hesitated for a moment before standing straight behind Xiao Yan like wooden pillars. Although these fellows belonged to the category of arrogant individuals that were difficult to tame, they felt respectful and fearful toward Xiao Yan. Their hearts truly viewed him as their leader.</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong absorbed all of the actions of the group into his eyes. His heart also vaguely guessed some things.</p><br/><p>There were also quite a number of core members within the Primer clan within the hall. However, at this very moment, those people who had voiced some criticism of how Xiao Ding and the Xiao clan had brought quite a lot of trouble to them wore a respectful expression. Occasionally, they also gave a courteous smile when conversing with Xiao Ding. After the scene earlier, they already understood that from today on, the Xiao clan, which could only linger on its last breath under the protection of the Primer clan, would leap to become one of the strongest factions within the Jia Ma Empire. Even their Primer clan would not be able to catch up with them.</p><br/><p>The smile on Xiao Ding\u2019s face was as indifferent as it was before in the face of the changes on the faces of these people. He did not reveal any surprise at this scene. He had long knew that as long as he could endure until the day that Xiao Yan returned to the Jia Ma Empire, the Xiao clan would definitely prosper once again!</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong dismissed some of the female servants after settling in all the guest. Only then did he turned his head and voice his thoughts to Xiao Yan, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that you are planning to fight to the death with the Misty Cloud Sect after having returned, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Old Hai think that there is a possibility that the Xiao clan and the Misty Cloud Sect can coexist in the Jia Ma Empire?\u201d Xiao Yan laughed faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this is the case, I should perhaps tell you about the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s current strength\u2026\u201d Hai Bodong\u2019s expression gradually became solemn as he slowly spoke, \u201cThe Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s development during these three years has far exceeded your expectations. You should know that three years ago, the entire Misty Cloud Sect, with the exception of Yun Shan, only had Yun Yun as an elite Dou Huang. Now, however, even with Yun Du and Yun Sha being killed in your hands, it is likely that the Misty Cloud Sect still possess no less than three Dou Huangs in it. It should also have some expert Dou Wangs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey should have used some sort of method to forcefully raise their strength. Otherwise, it is impossible for them to have such progress.\u201d Xiao Yan held his teacup and narrowed his eyes. A moment later, he softly said, \u201cMoreover, the Dou Qi of Yun Di and Yun Sha earlier was quite superficial and weak despite them possessing the aura of an elite Dou Huang. Clearly, they had consumed some sort of medicinal pill or used some sort of Secret Technique\u2026 hence, the strength of the Misty Cloud Sect may be stronger than it was three years ago but it is not impossible to defeat them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong was also startled when he heard this. It seemed that even he had felt extremely surprised that Xiao Yan was actually able to clearly identify some of the shortcomings of the Misty Cloud Sect within such a short period of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cYa Fei jie has built a large information network during these few years. With her help, I have discovered that there seems to be traces of some other mysterious faction within the Misty Cloud Sect. Perhaps, this should have some relation to the Misty Cloud Sect currently possessing so many experts.\u201d Hai Bodong frowned and slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently lifted his eyebrows. That mysterious faction was definitely the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019. Otherwise, with Yun Shan\u2019s strength, he would not have the ability to allow the strength of the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s Elders to soar so greatly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s strength is spread over most of the Jia Ma Empire. It is likely that it will be difficult if you want to rely on your own strength. Hence, I advise you that it would be best to pull the remaining two large clans, the Alchemist Association, and the imperial family to your side. The actions of the Misty Cloud Sect these few years have caused them to be extremely dissatisfied. However, due to the strength of Yun Shan, most of them only dared to be angry and didn\u2019t dare to give voice to it. Your return this time around is also a good thing to them. After all, there would be some chances of victory if you are included in a head on battle with Yun Shan.\u201d Hai Bodong mused for a moment before speaking his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey actually also possess the courage of having other thoughts about the Misty Cloud Sect?\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth was lifted into ridicule as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are still bearing a grudge over those things that happened back then, but you cannot blame them. The Misty Cloud Sect is really too strong. They need to think about their clan members.\u201d Hai Bodong shook his head and spoke helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you have brought quite a number of experts back to the Jia Ma Empire this time around, I will say some unpleasant words. By just relying on their strength, it is still much weaker than the Misty Cloud Sect. Moreover, the Misty Cloud Sect also has the extremely frightening Yun Shan. That old man who won\u2019t die is much stronger than he was three years ago. If it is just you alone\u2026\u201d Hai Bodong spoke in a solemn manner. Given his eyesight, he was naturally able to see the strength of Lin Yan and the others currently in the hall. Ten plus expert Dou Wangs. This was not considered an enormous lineup against the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan merely smiled as he looked at Old Hai\u2019s solemn expression. He softly said, \u201cI naturally know that it is impossible to overturn the Misty Cloud Sect by just relying on moisturizer\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan suddenly clapped his hands after saying this. The clap resounded across the hall before it was transmitted out of it by a slight thread of Dou Qi.</p><br/><p>Not long after Xiao Yan\u2019s clapping sounded, the slight sound of rushing wind suddenly appeared. A moment later, three figures suddenly rushed over from outside of the building. Finally they landed in the hall. The ones who appeared were surprisingly Old Yin Gu, Su Mei, and Tie Wu, the three elite Dou Huangs.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
