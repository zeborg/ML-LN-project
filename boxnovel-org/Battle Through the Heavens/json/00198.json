As the screech grew louder and clearer, the three green colored spots in Qing Lin\u2019s eyes suddenly let out a bright glow. The three spots transformed into three tiny green colored flowers in an instant\u2026</p><br/><p>Following the appearance of these strange green colored flowers, an intense glow suddenly shot out from Qing Lin\u2019s eyes and struck the Flame Spirit Serpent in front of her.</p><br/><p>Being exposed to this somewhat strange glow, the huge body of the Flame Spirit Serpent suddenly stiffened. Its pair of huge eyes were filled with some fear as they stared at the little girl in front of it.</p><br/><p>The strange glow slowly moved on the Flame Spirit Serpent\u2019s body and finally stopped at the middle of the two foreheads of the two snake heads\u2026 After the glow stopped moving, it began to gradually shrink. As the size of the glow became smaller, the light that it gave off grew increasingly rich.</p><br/><p>The area of the glow continued to become smaller. At the end, it was around the size of a palm. When the glow shrunk to this size, it ceased becoming smaller. A beam of light shot out and two small green colored flowers were imprinted onto the two heads of the Flame Spirit Serpent.</p><br/><p>After the flowers appeared, the glow began to gradually disappear. A moment later, the tiny flowers swiftly disappeared from Qing Lin\u2019s eyes and her eyes returned to their original dark green in an instant\u2026</p><br/><p>After her eyes returned to normal, Qing Lin\u2019s body swayed. Her eyelids fell and she collapsed on the ground.</p><br/><p>That huge Flame Spirit Serpent continued to foolishly stay on the spot after Qing Lin collapsed. However, every time it swept its gaze onto Qing Lin on the ground, the viciousness and savageness would involuntarily disappear. Replacing it was actually a meekness\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you!\u201d When the Flame Spirit Serpent was in a daze, Xiao Yan finally broke through the air and appeared. The Heavy Xuan Ruler viciously smashed onto its huge body. Instantly, fresh blood was splashed as it was beaten badly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d Having received a heavy blow again, the Flame Spirit Serpent finally regained consciousness. It turned its huge body and started furiously at Xiao Yan. However, when its gaze swept across the huge Heavy Xuan Ruler, look of dread appeared in its eyes. Under Xiao Yan\u2019s furious expression, it once again dived into the magma lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d Eyeing the Flame Spirit Serpent which chose to flee, Xiao Yan could not help but curse. He then flapped his pair of wings and swiftly appeared by Qing Lin side. In a hurried manner, he picked her up and placed his finger below her nose, heaving a sigh of relief when he felt a breath.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan withdrew an injury healing medicinal pill from his storage ring and forced it into Qing Lin\u2019s mouth. He then carried her and gradually walked into the tunnel. When he saw the wounded Xiao Ding, he gave a bitter smile and handed him an injury healing medicine before saying, \u201cHow is it? Is there something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*, it\u2019s nothing serious. I will be alright after resting for awhile.\u201d Xiao Ding took the medicinal pill and swallowed it. Xiao Ding exhaled and smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan leaned against the wall, slowly sat down and hugged Qing Lin into his chest. He rubbed his dust covered face, \u201cToo bad. I haven\u2019t found the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLater, bring Qing Lin back with you. I will stay here and continue searching. Don\u2019t worry. That beast will only flee when it sees me now. There isn\u2019t anything here that can hurt me now.\u201d Xiao Yan mused for a moment before tilting his head as he told Xiao Ding.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 alright. If we continue to stay here, we will only be a burden to you.\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Ding helplessly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the crypt here is so huge and there are flames all over. It won\u2019t be a simple thing for you to search for the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Moreover, I cannot stay too long here. Otherwise, if my movement is detected by some strong people, I\u2019m afraid there will be real trouble\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan nodded and laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Ding also nodded and laughed sorely. He was very clear about the attraction the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 posed to those other strong people.</p><br/><p>\u201cUghh...\u201d Just when Xiao Yan felt helpless, Qing Lin, who was on his chest, slowly woke up. She shook her dizzy small head and lifted it. When she saw Xiao Yan hugging her, her face reddened as her small fingers rubbed her temple. She suddenly said softly, \u201cYoung Master, Qing Lin may be able to locate where the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan and Xiao Ding were initially at a loss. Xiao Yan asked in a stunned voice, \u201cHow would you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Lin pressed her lips together and smiled. She suddenly escaped Xiao Yan\u2019s embrace and ran toward the cave entrance. With her hands around her small mouth, she shouted, \u201cCome out!\u201d</p><br/><p>As her shout died off, the huge Flame Spirit Serpent suddenly lifted its body from the calm magma lake. After which, it slowly swam toward the tunnel exit.</p><br/><p>Seeing the Flame Spirit Serpent, Xiao Yan became shocked. He quickly stood up, grabbed his heavy ruler and intently watched the Flame Spirit Serpent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master, don\u2019t hit it. It will not attack us.\u201d Noticing Xiao Yan\u2019s action, Qing Lin hurriedly grabbed him and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes stared intently at the Flame Spirit Serpent. When he realized that it currently did not possess any intention to attack. he could not help but ask in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not too sure\u2026\u201d Qing Lin shook her head and took two steps forward. Her dark green eyes stared at the huge creature in front of her and said with an uncertain voice, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I seem to have built a strange bond with it. I can sense it\u2019s thoughts...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d Xiao Yan was at a loss. His gaze swept across the Flame Spirit Serpent in front of him that had suddenly become docile. Finally, his gaze stopped at the green colored flower on one of it\u2019s foreheads. He frowned. That thing was something that was not present before\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, tsk tsk\u2026 how incredible. Little boy, I don\u2019t know if you are unlucky or lucky. Why is it that the people you meet are all so unusual? The last time was someone with a Woeful Poison Body, this time is not any worse. You actually met a little girl who possesses the \u2018Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils\u2019...\u201d When Xiao Yan was confused, Yao Lao suddenly marveled with a laugh from his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils\u2019? What is that?\u201d Hearing the foreign term, Xiao Yan inquired in wonder.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm... how do I put it\u2026 these are strange inborn pupils. It seems that they will only appear in the descendants of humans and Snake-People. Those individuals who possess these pupils can cause people to hallucinate if they are proficient in using them. Think about it, if you could suddenly cause your opponent to be in a daze mid-fight, or to a greater extent cause the other person to hack at his companion. How would you feel?\u201d Yao Lao grinned and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 that would definitely be very fun.\u201d Xiao Yan opened his mouth, wiped off his cold sweat and laughed dryly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdditionally, these kind of pupils can be said to be the nemesis of all snake form Magic Beasts. This is because there is some probability of them forming a one-sided forceful connection with a snake form Magic Beast\u2026 Ah, you can consider this kind of forceful relationship as a very rare mysterious contract.\u201d Yao Lao smilingly said, \u201cIt is clear that the Flame Spirit Serpent in front of you has unluckily signed a contract with the unskilled \u2018Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils\u2019 of this little girl\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...Damn\u2026\u201d Opening his mouth, Xiao Yan cursed softly. He immediately lowered his head and watched the small timid looking face of Qing Lin beside him. In the future, this little girl would have an incredible bodyguard. A Dou Ling level Magic Beast bodyguard. Tsk tsk\u2026 he had not seen anyone who possessed a pet with this kind of combat level.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Master\u2026 it knows where the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is.\u201d Qing Lin pointed at the Flame Spirit Serpent in front of her, took credit, as she said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt knows?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan was at a loss as he licked his lips. \u201cWhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm...\u201d Qing Lin closed her eyes and thought quietly for a moment. She then opened her eyes, swept her gaze in all directions and finally pointed awkwardly at the hot magma lake below. In a timid voice, she said, \u201cIt says\u2026 it is underneath.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth twitched as his gaze followed the direction of Qing Lin\u2019s finger and shifted to the hot fiery red magma lake. Under the magma? It was unexpected that the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was actually hidden under the magma. But\u2026 must he jump into it to search? Won\u2019t that kill him?</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, so that\u2019s why. No wonder I was unable to sense the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. It was actually covered by the magma in this crypt.\u201d From within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart, Yao Lao abruptly laughed in a manner that suggested he had suddenly realized something</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026 here, can I jump down?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan pulled at his mouth and dryly laughed as he pointed to the bubbling hot magma below.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, if you want to obtain the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, it would naturally not be too easy. So how is it? Do you dare to jump?\u201d Yao Lao laughed blandly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan swallowed his saliva. The corner of his eyes glanced at the fiery red magma and his throat rolled a little. His expression flipped quite quickly.</p><br/><p>Standing by the side, Qing Lin watched Xiao Yan with his swiftly changing expression and was also extremely uncertain. She did not dare vouch for the information that the Flame Spirit Serpent passed to her. If something were to happen to Xiao Yan after he jumped down, it was likely she would be in blame\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d After being quiet for a long time, Xiao Yan finally exhaled softly. He tilted his head toward Qing Lin and whispered, \u201cLet it lead the way below!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh...\u201d Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, Qing Lin\u2019s small body immediately trembled. She could only close her eyes and give the orders to the Flame Spirit Serpent.</p><br/><p>Upon receiving the order, an unwillingness flashed in the Flame Spirit Serpent\u2019s huge eyes. However, the forceful connection meant that it could only hiss toward Xiao Yan and dive into the magma. It then lifted its huge head and watched the unmoving Xiao Yan with both ridicule and provocation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d Staring at the Flame Spirit Serpent which had leaped in, Xiao Yan exhaled a few long breaths. His chest rose and fell. A moment later, he suddenly closed his eyes and under both Qing Lin and Xiao Ding\u2019s shocked gaze, leaped head first into the hot magma.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan leap into the magma, Xiao Ding\u2019s and Qing Lin\u2019s hearts suddenly became extremely anxious. Their eyes stared intently at the swiftly falling figure.</p><br/><p>An intense and hot wind blew past Xiao Yan\u2019s ear. The heart in his chest repeatedly beat violently, releasing beat after beat of muffled sound, as though it was just by his ear\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>The temperature grew increasingly hot and at one instance, he felt that he was completely isolated from the racket of the outside world.</p><br/><p>\u201cSplash\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Following this clear sound similar to plunging into water, the feelings of the three inside the crypt suddenly tensed up into a spring that would collapse with the slightest pull...</p><br/>\n</div>"}
