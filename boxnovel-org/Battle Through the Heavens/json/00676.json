He held the dark-blue longsword tightly in his hand and the Dou Qi within his body churned unceasingly, appearing like floodwater. The shock in his heart had been greatly reduced as his eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan. A thought, however, had rose in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat will definitely look for the Misty Cloud Sect to take revenge now that he has returned to the Jia Ma Empire. Looks like I must send this information to the sect. Otherwise, we might be caught off guard in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Fan\u2019s eyes flickered. He turned his head toward the similarly pale-faced Meng Li and said in a soft and quick manner, \u201cI will delay him. Take the opportunity to leave. After which inform the sect leader of Xiao Yan\u2019s return!\u201d He did not wait for Meng Li\u2019s response after his words sounded. His shoulders shook and a pair of pale-blue Dou Qi wings surged out. His feet gently pressed on the ground and his body turned into a vague shadow. It was mixed with sharp blade wind as he shot toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Tie\u2019s heart tightened when he saw Yun Fan suddenly attack and hurriedly cried out a reminder. However, he had just recovered after his reminder had sounded. The young man who was currently in front of him was no longer the young man who was chased like a dog that had lost its home back then.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned his head and smiled to Mu Tie. A cluster of jade-green flames suddenly appeared on his hand. He lifted his eyes slightly and saw the man and sword which were swiftly magnified in his eyes. The corner of his mouth moved. A faint silver colored glow flashed and appeared under his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The deep-blue longsword carried a sharp sword aura as it tore through the air. It carried a dark, cold wind as it shot toward Xiao Yan\u2019s chest. When everyone\u2019s gaze were focused on him, Yun Fan suddenly cried out sternly, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Li, who was already ready by the side, stomped his feet violently on the ground. His body was like a cannonball as he rushed out of the city governor\u2019s mansion in a lightning-like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go?\u201d Xiao Yan coldly smiled as he heard the rushing wind sound that appeared when Meng Li fled. His left hand was extended before it was abruptly clenched. A powerful suction force immediately erupted from his palm.</p><br/><p>A wild wind immediately surfaced from the powerful suction force. Even the enormous rocks in the yard began to tremble violently. Some of the tree trunks were broken. The body of Meng Li, who was fleeing, suddenly paused in mid-air. His body swiftly pulled back. All his struggle was to no avail.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The longsword in Yun Fan\u2019s hand suddenly escaped from his hand just as Xiao Yan sucked Meng Li over. It transformed into a deep-blue cold glit that pierced violently toward Xiao Yan\u2019s chest, which was in close proximity. When the sword left his hand, the pair of wings on Yun Fan\u2019s back flapped swiftly and he rushed to the sky in the blink of an eye before turning his body around to flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cBait huh\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan raised his brows in surprise when Yun Fan suddenly abandoned his attack, turned around, and fled. This old fellow was indeed a treacherous person. Earlier, he had only asked Meng Li to flee first so that he could use the latter to quietly get away.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan, Zi Yan, and the others who was coincidentally leisurely by the side were just about to move after seeing Yun Fan flee when Xiao Yan\u2019s laughter stopped them, \u201cAllow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xiao Yan\u2019s laughter sounded, Meng Li, who was originally flying toward him under the influence of the suction force, suddenly paused in mid-air. An instant later, a powerful pushing force once again surged out from Xiao Yan\u2019s palm. Finally, it smashed firmly on the back of Meng Li. The latter\u2019s expression suddenly became pale after being assaulted by these two forces. A mouthful of bright-red fresh blood was immediately spat out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and the sky rippled. An invisible force randomly swung Meng Li into the wall. Finally, he landed heavily on the ground with an unknown fate.</p><br/><p>Meng Li\u2019s body had just landed on the ground when Xiao Yan\u2019s body, which was in the yard, strangely disappeared. The eyeballs of Mu Tie and the others nearly popped out when they saw his ghost-like figure. Was this speed not a little too frightening.</p><br/><p>The faint rumble of thunder reverberated in the yard as Xiao Yan\u2019s body disappeared. A moment later, the sharp sound of rushing wind suddenly appeared in the sky just as Mu Tie and the others were looking at each other. A human body immediately fell from the sky in a miserable manner. Finally, it violently smashed into the ground and dust immediately spread all over the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cA mere three star Dou Wang. If I were to allow you to flee in front of me, how would I be able to talk about ending the grudge with Yun Shan?\u201d A soft laugh sounded in the sky. Everyone raised their heads and saw the young man who was carrying a heavy ruler flapping his jade-green fire wings as he slowly floated in the air. His gaze was indifferent as he looked at the human figure that had fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>The dust gradually scattered in the yard. Yun Fan\u2019s figure was slowly revealed. However, at this moment, this Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s Elder, who was usually aloof, displayed a pale face at this moment. There was still remnant traces of blood on the corner of his mouth. Both of his eyes carried a fear and disbelief as he looked at the black-robed, young man in the sky. The two of them had not even exchanged more than three blows earlier when he descended into a seriously injured state. The other party\u2019s strength was actually this terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, if you kill me, sect leader Yun Shan will definitely not let you off! The last time, you were able to luckily escape with your life. I\u2019m afraid that you will not have such good luck this time around!\u201d Yun Fan glanced at Meng Li, whose fate was unknown, by the corner of the wall. His eyelids twitched as he spoke with a brave exterior.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lifted the corner of his mouth into a ridiculing smile. He shook his head and was too lazy to say any unnecessary words. A cluster of green flame surfaced from his palm with a flick of his finger. The temperature of the surroundings instantly became hot with the appearance of this cluster of flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Misty Cloud Sect has destroyed my Xiao clan. This vengeance is something that I will get them to pay many times back. In the future, I will kill every single member of the Misty Cloud Sect. It will sooner or later be the turn of old dog Yun Shan.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed faintly. His gaze looked at the cluster of dark-green flame in his hand and immediately shook his head. With a flick of his finger, the cluster of flame left his hand and immediately shot accurately toward the frightened Yun Fan.</p><br/><p>The jade-green flame had just made contact with Yun Fan\u2019s body when the latter ignited on fire. The already seriously injured Yun Fan did not have time to maneuver Dou Qi to resist this kind of frighteningly high temperature. His body erupted into charred black ashes amid a low, deep sound.</p><br/><p>The entire yard was completely silent as they looked at the pile of charred black ashes on the ground. Although the sun was hanging high in the sky at this moment, Mu Tie and the others appeared as though they were in a deep abyss. Their entire bodies were icy-cold. An elite Dou Wang who was still leaping around in a lively manner earlier had ended up without even a corpse in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeves and a wind blew, scattering the charred black ashes on the ground. The jade-green fire wings on Xiao Yan\u2019s back slowly disappeared. A silver glow flashed under his feet and his body once again appeared in the yard in a ghost-like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Mu Tie, we have not met for three years. Are you still well?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s feet landed on the ground. The coldness on his face instantly disappeared as a warm smile once again filled the young man with sunlight. However, no one would think that this young man was some gentle-hearted person after the scene earlier.</p><br/><p>A stiff smile was revealed on Mu Tie\u2019s face when he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s voce. That manner was extremely ugly. He, too, seemed to have sensed something as he immediately rubbed his face violently. Only then did he spoke with a bitter smile, \u201cYou\u2026 are you really Xiao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was dumbfounded when he heard this. He grinned and said, \u201cIs there anyone else within the Jia Ma Empire who dares to call himself Xiao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Tie nodded his head in an embarrassed manner. Indeed, the name Xiao Yan, had basically become a taboo word within the Jia Ma Empire during these few years. This was all because that enormous sect held a deep hatred for this name!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Mu Tie, thank you very much for the matter back then.\u201d Xiao Yan slowly walked toward Mu Tie and smiled as he spoke. Those guards beside the latter immediately tensed up. Their hands were trembling a little as they held their weapons. They had just witnessed, with their own eyes, an elite Dou Wang ending up without even a corpse because of this young man.</p><br/><p>Mu Tie waved his hand and scattered the surrounding disgraceful guards. Only at this moment was Mu Tie able to completely sense that the matter that had just happened was reality and not an illusion\u2026 however, this reality was far too unbelievable.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*... brother Xiao Yan. Ke ke, actually, I had received a mail from my clan back then to get me to quietly provide you help if possible. However, I think that it would not be a difficult thing for you to leave the \u2018Zhen Gui Pass\u2019 given your strength back then. That little help of mine is nothing much.\u201d Mu Tie rubbed his head. That strong build of his caused him to display an honest and straightforward feeling when he smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, the Mu clan huh. Xiao Yan will remember it.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and pointed toward the exterior of the city governor\u2019s mansion. He said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for my attack being too strong. You might need to personally show yourself and clear up the place.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Tie sniffed the bloody stench that was spreading over from the outside. He immediately laughed bitterly. This fellow was indeed no longer the sentimental and tender young man of the past. This time around, I\u2019m afraid that the Misty Cloud Sect will truly be turned upside down with greater intensity because of this young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Xiao Yan, no matter what, I have to thank you for intervening today. Otherwise, it is likely that Meng Li\u2019s trick would have succeeded.\u201d Mu Tie spoke sincerely as he cupped his hands toward Xiao Yan with a serious expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and waved his hand. After which he crossed his fingers and said softly, \u201cI have not been to the Jia Ma Empire for three years. Can I get big brother Mu Tie to tell me about the current situation within Jia Ma Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, the Jia Ma Empire has been extremely eventful during these few years. All of these matters were caused by the Misty Cloud Sect.\u201d Mu Tie knit his brows and sighed. He immediately said to Xiao Yan, \u201cIt is going to be a long story. If brother Xiao Yan is not in a hurry to leave, please enter the house and allow me to tell you in detail.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan mused for a moment after hearing this. However, he did not reject the offer. Now that he was back within the empire, the most important thing was to understand the situation within the empire. Otherwise, it would be the most foolish act to simply go on a rampage.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I will trouble big brother Mu Tie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Tie immediately rejoiced when he saw that Xiao Yan did not reject him. He hurriedly invited Xiao Yan into the hall. He clearly understood that if the matter of Xiao Yan returning to the Jia Ma Empire were to spread, it would definitely become a big event and the most sensational one in the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
