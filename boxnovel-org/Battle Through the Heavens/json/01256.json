Other than a small number of lone rangers, most of the remaining people were all from fractions that possessed quite a great reputation in the Central Plains. This included the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe, Wind Lightning Pavilion, Ice River Valley, Burning Flame Valley and other factions. All of them were already here. It seemed that their target was quite clear. All of them had directly hurried over to this place after entering the remains.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s group had naturally immediately attracted the attention of quite a number of people when they entered the large hall. Numerous eyes that were cautious, filled with enmity or friendliness were being shot over.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled in the face of these gazes. His eyes glanced at the spot where Feng Qing Er was located. The latter was staring at him in a dark and solemn manner. It was likely that they still remembered the great loss that they had suffered within the beast spiritual barrier earlier. A cold smile surfaced on the corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth when he saw this scene. He lead everyone and slowly walked into the large hall in front of many gazes. After which, she halted her footsteps within the large hall.</p><br/><p>After having walked into the large hall, Xiao Yan finally discovered that the dozen over human figures seated around the towering stone seat. These human figures were stone gray in colour. They appeared just like stone statue from a great distance. Both of their eyes were tightly shut. They had maintained this stance of theirs for countless number of years. Despite this being the case, the bodies of these dozen over stone statue like figures caused everyone to be afraid of being within a hundred feet from the stone chair.</p><br/><p>\u201cPuppets?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Fairy Doctor softly exclaimed in surprise when she saw these stone status like human figures that did not possess any life.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 moreover, they are likely quite a high grade puppet. This kind of feeling is similar to the Sky Demon Puppet. If I guess correctly, these dozen over puppets possess the strength of the Dou Zun class.\u201d A serious expression als flashed across Xiao yan\u2019s eyes. These puppets might not be moving at this moment but this was merely because they were not activated. One could imagine just what kind of fierce and ruthless miserable killing it would be should these puppets be activated.</p><br/><p>The expression of Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group changed slightly when they heard this. Over a dozen Dou Zuns. Even if this kind of lineup could be finished off by those experts present, the loss that they would suffer would also be quite great.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed worthy of being the remains left by an elite Dou Sheng\u2026 if they were to fight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Lin also had a surprised face. This kind of lineup caused even her to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone should be careful later on. Do not separate\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was grave as he reminded. After which, he turned his head. A smile rapidly appeared on his face. He cupped his hands together towards a certain direction. Little Fairy Doctor and the others looked over. It was actually the group from the Burning Flame Valley.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, young friend Xiao Yan. Arriving just in time is better than arriving earlier. The seal on this place is becoming increasingly weak. It is likely that it will completely disappear soon\u2026\u201d Tang Zhen smiled when he saw Xiao yan. He led the experts from the Burning Flame Valley over and smilingly spoke to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cValley Chief Tang, could this be the intention of this trip? Why would there be ten of them?\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and asked. It was likely that he had the best relationship with the Burning Flame Valley amongst those present. The others were either people whom he was unfamiliar with or who were his enemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it should be right. However, I think that there should only be one true Tian class Dou Techniques amongst these ten. As for who can obtain it, it will depend on the person\u2019s luck and strength.\u201d Tang Zhen smilingly nodded and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Nine fakes and one real\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. His eyes swept over the ten light clusters in surprised. There were indeed many tricks within this ancient remains. It had actually pulled such a trick at the end. Attempting to obtain the true Tian class Dou Technique from amongst these ten was not going to be easy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201d Tang Zhen smiled. His eyes swept over the surrounding large hall and softly said, \u201cYoung friend, it looks like there are quite a number of people who are against you this time around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are merely some small problems\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. Amongst those present, only the Heaven Demon Pheonix tribe, Wind Lightning Pavilion and Ice River Valley had an enmity with him. The sum of the experts from these three parties would at the very most be equal to that of his side. It was difficult to tell who would win if they were to fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I have forgotten that you are currently no longer alone.\u201d Tang Zhen glanced at the people behind Xiao Yan. An emotional sigh also flashed across his eyes. With his eyesight, he was naturally able to tell just how frightening the lineup of Xiao Yan\u2019s group was. If the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe, Wind Lightning Pavilion and the Ice River Valley did not join hands, it was likely that none of them could contend against Xiao Yan\u2019s group alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strongest here is not some faction. There is an unknown number of lone individuals who had come after hearing word of this remains. Most of these people possess some skills. Although their cohesion is not as great as a faction, their fighting strength are quite great. They are also vicious characters when it comes to snatching.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. He had met quite a number of strong treasure seekers along the way. Although these people would usually not offend these large factions for no reason, under the allure of the Tian class Dou Technique, all of their fear and restraint would disappear. After all, if they really managed to obtain the Tian class Dou Technique, they, being alone, could directly hide in the vast deep mountains. Who could find them?</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen also smiled when he heard this. His gaze turned towards the ten light clusters at the middle of the large hall. At this moment, the surrounding light of these clusters were becoming increasingly weak. Clearly, it was because the seal was losing its effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung friend Xiao Yan, can you tell which scroll within these ten light clusters is the Tian class Dou Technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly when he heard Tang Zhen\u2019s words. The Spiritual Strength between his brows spread. After sensing for a moment, he shook his head and said, \u201cThe seal has completely blocked off all probing. Given my strength, how could I see through something that is placed by an elite Dou Sheng. With things developing in this manner, we can only see just who is lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is insufficient to possess sufficient luck. There are so many people with malicious intent here. It will be a hot potato when it lands on one hands. One would instead become the common enemy of everyone.\u201d Tang Zhen laughingly said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan fell into a deep thought and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this place will definitely become extremely chaotic in awhile. We might perhaps be able to join hands should any unexpected situation occurs.\u201d Tang Zhen glanced towards the Ice River Valley. After which, he swept his eyes over those seated puppets, which appeared to have entered a slumber, and said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly and nodded. The Burning Flame Valley was strong. Moreover, with Xiao Yan\u2019s current eyesight, he was naturally able to see through Tang Zhen\u2019s strength. A five star Dou Zun or so. He was even stronger when compared to the valley chief of the Ice River Valley, Bing He zun-zhe and would not lose to that old ghost Zhai Xing from the Hall of Souls. Xiao Yan was naturally extremely willing to form an alliance with an expert of this level. After all, the current him was faced with enemies from multiple fronts. It was always good to have another helper.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdditionally, be careful of those puppets\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen fondled his beard and suddenly spoke softly, \u201cIf I guess correctly, these puppets will awaken when the seal is undone. At that time, it will definitely be an extremely chaotic bloody battle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly as she nodded gently. The current situation was quite complicated. Not only did not need to be cautious against some opponents but one must still be careful of these mysterious and powerful puppets. If one was careless and end up falling at the most unexpected place, it would really be the case of being unable to voice one\u2019s bitterness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, as for now\u2026 let\u2019s wait until the seal disappears. There are no free lunches in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly when he heard this soft sigh from Tang Zhen. His eyes swept over those gazes present. Finally, it suddenly paused on the skeleton on the stone chair. A thought passed through his heart. Refining Yao Lao\u2019s body require the bones of an expert. This Dou Sheng\u2019s skeleton was still quite complete. If it could be used as a body, could it aid Yao Lao in advancing to the Dou Sheng class?</p><br/><p>If Yao Lao was truly able to become an elite Dou Sheng, they would no longer need to be that afraid of the Hall of Soul in the future. Moreover, the strength of the Falling Star Pavilion would also instantly reach the level of the Pill Tower. It would possess the capital to truly contend against the Hall of Soul!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is possible, I can try to see if I can snatch that skeleton\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A glint flickered within Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. His heart also placed his attention on the skeleton.</p><br/><p>During the time they waited for the seal to disappear, some experts and factions had also continuously arrive at this large hall. With an increasing number of experts arriving at this place, the atmosphere within the large hall had become slightly tensed. Everyone were aware that in awhile, those whom they were still smiling and greeting a short time ago would kill them without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Under this kind of atmosphere, some of the factions with relations with each other or some experts who were familiar with each other began to quietly gather. In such a chaotic place, it was likely impossible to obtain the treasure by just relying on the strength of a single person/</p><br/><p>An increasing number of experts were present within the large hall. This caused Xiao Yan to involuntarily frown slightly. He threw an expression towards Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group and they began to gradually lean closer to each other. All of their hearts began to become more cautious.</p><br/><p>Chi chi!</p><br/><p>Numerous hurried figures continuously rushed towards the large hall. Although there were more and more people within the large hall, it was still frighteningly quiet. The pressuring atmosphere caused quite a number of people to have some cold sweat. Dou Qi was gushing through every part of their bodies. Any slight commotion and the Dou Qi would be stirred, erupting into a shocking lethal strength.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hands were inserted into his sleeves. His eyes were slightly shut as his Spiritual Strength covered the interior of this large hall. However, the thing that caused him to feel a little strange was that he had not discovered any experts from the Hall of Soul. Could it be that they did not possess much interest in this ancient remains?</p><br/><p>\u201cThese fellows alway arrive when there are treasures. Why would\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The muttering within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart had yet to appear when his expression suddenly changed. His slight shut eyes were suddenly opened. Just when he had opened his eyes, a strange laughter transformed into a sharp sonic wave that appeared both near and far as it resounded across this large hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, looks like I am not late this time around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A killing intent surged within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart when he heard this somewhat familiar strange laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave they finally arrived\u2026 old ghost Zhai Xing!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}
