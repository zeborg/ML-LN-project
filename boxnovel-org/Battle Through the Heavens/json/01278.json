Their gazes were surprised as they looked at the distant sky. Due to the defensive formation that was naturally formed by the meteorite, they were unable to see the situation outside. However, they were vaguely able to sense that the Falling Star Pavilion seemed to be faced with a great calamity.</p><br/><p>Feng zun-zhe and the others were gathered on a square on the mountain top. Their expressions were grave as they looked at the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hall of Soul have come\u2026\u201d Tian Huo zun-zhe knitted his brows and spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many strong auras outside. This time around, it seems that the Hall of Soul really intend to wash the Falling Star Pavilion in blood as a deterrence to others\u2026\u201d A solemness appeared on Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s face as she spoke.</p><br/><p>Feng zun-zhe nodded slightly. However, his expression was calm. He was aware that this day would arrive sooner or later. It was just a matter of time.</p><br/><p>Feng zun-zhe slowly stepped forward. The seal in his hand changed and the Falling Star array in the sky rippled. Immediately, the space slowly became distorted and the situation outside clearly appeared in front of everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone involuntarily inhaled a breath of cool air when they saw the scene in the outside world. Currently, the area outside of the Falling Star Pavilion had been surrounded by black fog that permeated the sky. Nearly a hundred figures stood on the black fog in the sky a short distance in front of them. Dark and dense eyes penetrated through the formation and saw Feng zun-zhe\u2019s group that was hiding within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld ghost Zhai Xing. This old ghost has also come\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Fairy Doctor glanced and found a familiar face amongst the many black clothed people. Her face turned cold as she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is also the Hei Bai Tianzun whom we had met back then\u2026\u201d Feng zun-zhe shook his head and slowly said.</p><br/><p>The faces of Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group involuntarily changed when they heard these words of his. Their gaze looked towards where Feng zun-zhe was watching and did indeed see two old men in black and white clothes standing there. From the appearance of these two, they were surprisingly the Hei Bai Tianzun whom they had met once at the Death Soul Mountain Range.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree elite Tianzuns had actually arrived\u2026 this Hall of Soul really seems to think highly of us.\u201d Feng zun-zhe let out a long exhale as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cPavilion chief Feng, what should we do now? The Hall of Soul has launched a big campaign. Moreover, from this momentum, it seems that they are not merely here to demand for someone\u2026\u201d An Elder from the Falling Star Pavilion spoke with a somewhat terrified expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is there to panic about? The Hall of Soul is not some kind association. They are planning to wash the Falling Star Pavilion in blood. Otherwise, why would they directly dispatch three elite Tianzuns?\u201d Feng zun-zhe frowned and chided. After which, his eyes looked around the star realm. He watched those thousands of Falling Star Pavilion disciple and spoke in a deep voice, \u201cTherefore, there is no other path except to engage in an all out fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone here are elders within the Falling Star Pavilion. Today, the Falling Star Pavilion is faced with a calamity that we have never faced before. All of you plan to\u2026\u201d Feng zun-zhe\u2019s searing gazes turned towards the many Elders of the Falling Star Pavilion and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cPavilion chief Feng, the Falling Star Pavilion is our root. The amount of effort we have put in for it is not less than anyone. Regardless of whoever it is that wish to destroy it, we will all fight to our deaths against them!\u201d The many Elders had solemn expressions as they cried out in usion.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. I, Feng Xian, really have good eyesight. In that case, let out fight till our deaths. I wish to see just how dominating this Hall of Soul can be!\u201d Feng zun-zhe cried out with a great force, causing the morale of all the Falling Star Pavilion\u2019s disciples to be braced. From the perspective of many people here, the Falling Star Pavilion was their root. If it was destroyed by others, what face would they have to roam the Central Plains in the future?</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng zun-zhe, the old me advice you to obediently hand the people over. This Falling Star Pavilion\u2019s great formation cannot protect you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing\u2019s eyes were dark and dense as he looked at the space below. Although it was merely a sea of trees, he understood that this was only because of the Falling Star Pavilion great formation.</p><br/><p>The cold cry sounded but no response was given. Old ghost Zhai Xing involuntarily laughed out coldly when he saw this. His gaze turned towards the black white clothed elders by the side and said, \u201cLet\u2019s attack together and break the formation. The activity from this trip of ours is too big. It is likely that the eyes from quite a number of factions had followed us. Therefore, we must use a bloody method to suppress the Falling Star Pavilion and use this opportunity to allow the other factions on the Central Plains to be aware that our Hall of Soul is not something that just anyone is qualified to offend!</p><br/><p>That Black White Tianzuns nodded slightly when they heard this. Their gazes glanced below before raising their hands at the same time. After which, they violently grabbed the space below.</p><br/><p>After the hands of those three were clenched, a frightening spatial strength hurriedly spread over the place. Three invisible large hands grabbed heavily onto the empty space. A light surged immediately and an invisible light barrier containing the glow of the stars appeared in front of everyone\u2019s eyes from nowhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cBreak it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing coldly cried out. He suddenly clenched his hand violently. That invisible large hand violently smashed onto the invisible light barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>A fist landed and numerous ripples spread on the light barrier. A loud rumbling sound resounded over the sky in a thunder like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following closely behind old ghost Zhai Xing, the frightening wind from the Black White Tainzuns also swept down from the sky. Immediately, it poured onto the light in a storm like manner. Under this fierce attack by three elite Dou Zuns who had reached the five star Dou Zun level, that light had become shaky.</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>All the disciples within the Falling Star Pavilion looked at the repeatedly trembling light barrier from within the star realm. They suddenly held their weapons in their hands with a greater force.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe great formation is unable to endure the attacks from the three of them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng zun-zhe watched the light barrier that was about to be shattered. His expression sunk slightly as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hall of Soul has sent three Tianzuns over this time around. There are also seven Dou Zuns. Quite a number of Dou Zongs has also come\u2026\u201d Feng zun-zhe\u2019s eyes flickered as he spoke in a deep voice, \u201cThe seven Dou Zuns and the other experts are not considered troublesome to deal with. However, old ghost Zhai Xing trio is a great trouble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice paused before suddenly clenched his teeth and spoke, \u201cI will block both the Black White Tianzuns!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you alone be a match for the two of them?\u201d Little Fairy Doctor and the rest frowned immediately when they heard this. The other Elders of the Falling Star Pavilion also had a drastic change in expressions as they continuously objected.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to defeat them. All that we need to do is to delay the time until Yao Chen successfully exit his retreat\u2026\u201d Feng zun-zhe inhaled a deep breath and said.</p><br/><p>Everyone became quiet when they heard this. It had been half a month since Xiao Yan and Yao Lao had entered the stone tower. However, not even the slightest news was transmitted from it. Just what use this little bit of time was to them?</p><br/><p>\u201cI will deal with old ghost Zhai Xing. Leave one of the Black White Tianzuns to the Sky Demon Puppet. As for the other Tianzun, Little Fairy Doctor and Tian Huo zun-zhe will join hands to deal with him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While everyone were quietly and helpless, a calm voice suddenly resounded. Immediately, that skinny figure that caused Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group to calm down, also slowly appeared in the midair above the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 junior pavilion chief Xiao Yan? He has exited from the retreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The attention of all of the disciples within the Falling Star Pavilion was braced when Xiao Yan appeared. During these years, Xiao Yan could be considered to have really made a name for himself in the Central Plains. Everyone within the Falling Star Pavilion were also aware of his strength. His appearance was just like a great strength, causing the morale of the Falling Star Pavilion to surge.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have come out? What about Yao Chen?\u201d</p><br/><p>A joy immediately surfaced on Feng zun-zhe\u2019s face when he saw Xiao Yan appeared. He hurriedly asked the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe still needs time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly shook his head. His gaze looked at the repeatedly shaking light barrier. A densely cold faced old ghost Zhai Xing was outside of the light barrier. There was a cold glint flashing across his dark black eyes when he did so. This old ghost was really too hateful. Time and time again this old ghost had come and find trouble. This time around, he will definitely not allow this old ghost to escape!</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave the last Tianzun to me. Allow Little Fairy Doctor jie-jie and the rest to block the other elite Dou Zuns\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Lin by the side hesitated for a moment before she suddenly spoke softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Fairy Doctor was startled when she heard this. She glanced at Qing Lin, smiled warmly and said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, old mister Yao and I can block him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes also turned towards Qing Lin. The latter smiled at him. She crossed her hands together and said, \u201cYoung master Xiao Yan, you can be rest assured. I can block him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan knitted his brows slightly when he saw Qing Lin\u2019s insistence. Finally, he nodded slightly. Although Qing Lin\u2019s strength was only that of a one star Dou Zun, she possessed a mysterious treasure like the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils. Moreover, her body also hid the soul of an Ancient Heaven Serpent. Such a ferocious being was something that even Xiao Yan was unusually afraid of. From the looks of her appearance, it was likely that she was not merely putting up a brave front.</p><br/><p>Little Fairy Doctor was also startled when she saw Xiao Yan actually agreeing with Qing Lin. Immediately, she felt helpless. However, her heart was also a little rest assured. She understood that Xiao Yan was not a reckless person. He would not allow Qing Lin to fight with a Hall of Soul Tianzun without reason. Since he did this, it was likely that he had his reasons and his confidence.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand. Eleven puppets appeared in the midair. After which, his gaze was lifted and he slowly said, \u201cOpen the great formation. It is about to be broken\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng zun-zhe also nodded when he heard this. His hand seal changed and the light barrier in the sky trembled before slowly scattering. Following the disappearance of this light barrier, the entire place gradually became dark. The black fog that permeated the sky also appeared in front of everyone\u2019s gaze in close proximity.</p><br/><p>Old ghost Zhai Xing smiled coldly as he watched the slowly scattering light barrier in the sky. Immediately, his gaze penetrated through the space and looked towards the skinny figure standing on the mountain top. His dense voice carried a bone chilling coldness as it resounded over the entire sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, I have said that we will meet each other again. This time around, the old me will see just who will be able to rescue you!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}
