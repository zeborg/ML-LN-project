She did not find that figure unfamiliar.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit Restraining Net!\u201d</p><br/><p>Many figures flew over the sky after Xun Er\u2019s cold cry sounded. An orderly loud roar sounded while powerful Dou Qi swiftly formed into a huge Dou Qi net in the sky. Finally, it came pressing over that figure from all directions. The huge net contained a special fluctuation. If one was caught within the web, one would fall into the hands of the many Black Submerged Army\u2019s warriors and have difficulty escaping.</p><br/><p>\u201cExplode!\u201d</p><br/><p>That figure did not appear to panic in the face of the huge energy net. His hands formed some seals and dozens of ferocious wind shot out. The wind continuously shot towards the various parts of the net. Soon after, the wind whistled and actually forced the huge net back. After which, he hurriedly lifted his head and looked at the distant sky. His body moved and his speed was raised to the limit as he hurried towards the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s pointless. He is extremely familiar with the Black Submerged Army\u2019s Spirit Restraining Net. His attack completely targeted the weak spots on the net!\u201d Gu Qing Yang\u2019s expression sunk after he saw that the huge Dou Qi net, which was formed by gathering the Dou Qi of many warriors from the Black Submerged Army, being torn apart with such ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Gu Yang, you traitor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yang quickly rushed towards the sky. Gu Dao trio had also discovered him. Their expressions quickly turned cold. However, they were just about to attack when three of the four demon saints appeared in front of them in a ghost like manner. The last person formed a hand seal and a ten thousand feet large black light spluttered out from his palm and violent smashed onto the defensive light barrier. The frightening strength torn a crack line on the defence barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t let him escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sky was a complete chaos. Xun Er waved her hand. Although the Gu clan had many experts, many of the experts were unable to leave their position on the formation due to their need to defend against the Hun clan. However, they, who belonged to the younger generation, could act.</p><br/><p>Xun Er was the first to hurry forward after her cry sounded. Gu Qing Yang and the rest hurriedly followed from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should also fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huo Xuan on the stone platform of the training ground spoke in a deep voice after seeing this scene. His body quickly moved and the huge fire wings on his back were spread. He hurried towards the figure in the sky. Huo Ya and the few experts from the Yan clan behind him also attacked at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Lei Dong, what should we do?\u201d The younger generation from the Lei clan had also become a little absentminded from the shock of this big battle. Lei Yun hesitated for a moment before asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you should remain here. I will fight!\u201d Lei Dong knitted his brow tightly and cried out softly. A silver light flashed over his body. After which, he rushed forward. The other members of the Lei clan could only nod helplessly upon seeing this. Given their strength, they would be seriously injured if Gu Yang was to even touch them. This would end up being a burden to the rest.</p><br/><p>That figure in the sky was hurrying towards the crack line torn open by one of the four demon saints of the Hun clan, Hun Yan. However, he was still a thousand feet from the crack line when a couple of sharp winds suddenly appeared from behind him. They ruthlessly struck towards his fatal spots. At that moment, he could only pause his body and wave his sleeve. The few wind disappeared. However, in that instant, Xun Er\u2019s group had arrived in a flash and surrounded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Gu Yang, why have you done such a rebellious act?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er\u2019s stern cry sounded. Her pretty eyes contained some fury as she looked at the old man, who was in a messy state.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, do you really think that I am the real Gu Yang?\u201d That old man, who was in a mess, involuntarily laughed in a strange manner after hearing Xun Er\u2019s reprimand. The gap between the hair that was hung in front of his face revealed a pair of densely cold eyes. These eyes were completely different from the friendliness of the past.</p><br/><p>Xun Er\u2019s group shrunk their eyes. Their hearts involuntarily felt a chill. This Gu Yang was indeed an Elder of the Gu clan. If he was a fake, would it not mean that all the secrets of the Gu clan during the many years had been completely spread to the Hun clan?</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Yang\u2019s soul had been forcefully merged with me in the hands of Nihility sir a hundred years ago. I have been living in isolation during these years and did not dare to appear in front of Gu Yuan and the others. Fortunately, I have finally managed to wait for this day!\u201d Gu Yang laughed strangely. His body pulled backwards after his voice sounded. At the same time, many bright Dou Qi pillars shot out from the palm of Xun Er\u2019s group. They crossed each other and ruthlessly strike towards Gu Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cA group of young fellows actually intends to hold me back?\u201d Gu Yang laughed out loud. His palm violently pressed under him and the space was distorted in an instant. It directly solidified and blocked the many Dou Qi pillars.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, I shall take my leave first!\u201d Gu Yang once again laughed after blocking the attacks of Xun Er\u2019s group. He turned around and left. However, he was turning his body when a fist containing a pink flame directly tore open the space in front of him and smashed onto his chest with lightning like speed. The hot wind had incinerated the Dou Qi defence over Gu Yang\u2019s body within the blink of an eye. A blood red handprint appeared on his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to leave? Do you think that it is so easy?\u201d Xiao Yan stepped on the air and looked at the miserable looking Gu Yang with a cold smile. The ferocious aura of a six star Dou Sheng erupted from him, pressuring Gu Yang until the latter\u2019s expression changed drastically.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Hun Yan, save me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The powerful aura around Xiao Yan\u2019s body allowed Gu Yang to understand that he was definitely no match for the former in a fight. The latter hurriedly cried out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, how dare you spoil the plans of my Hun clan. You are seeking death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Yan had naturally clearly seen the events that had transpired. He was extremely furious after seeing Gu Yang being stopped. This was especially the case when the person stopping Gu Yang was Xiao Yan, who had managed to escape from his hands. A furious cry sounded and his finger pressed on the air. An unusually deep black light shot out. Finally, it rushed forward at a speed not visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithering Death Finger!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body had turned into a pink glass like manner the moment Hun Yan attacked. His aura also soared suddenly. He pressed his finger forward for a couple of times, \u201cYellow Spring Finger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>An incomparably huge energy finger broke through the air as Xiao Yan pressed his fingers continuously. One finger after another was pressed violently onto the unusual black light. Immediately, both parties clashed. The Yellow Spring Finger collapsed. Due to its large numbers, it managed to forcefully received all of Hun Yan\u2019s attack after destroying five large energy fingers.</p><br/><p>Hun Yan\u2019s expression suddenly sunk after he saw that Xiao Yan had directly receive his attack head on. Some surprise surged within his eyes. Back when they were at the Yao clan, Xiao Yan still needed to borrow the strength of the Heavenly Flame in order to push him back. Now, however, the other party was already able to rely on his own strength to put up some resistance. This improvement was a little too shocking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will just see how many figures you can receive today!</p><br/><p>Hun Yan\u2019s eyes flickered. Black light surged from his finger. Xiao Yan\u2019s strength was at the most at the six star Dou Sheng class. It had only been raised to this level through the use of Secret Technique. However, Xiao Yan was still greatly lacking if he wished to rely on this to fight Hun Yan head on.</p><br/><p>Hun Yan did not give Xiao Yan any time to catch his breath as he let out a cold cry. He pressed his ten fingers. Immediately, ten black light shot out and swiftly struck through the crack in the defence. After which, all of them targeted Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes hardened as he watched this scene. He curled his palm and gathered a fire lotus. Before his fire lotus could be formed, however, a strong figure suddenly rushed over. A punch was thrown and a seemingly mountain like vast and mighty aura came pressing downwards. It actually shattered those ten black rays of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cHun Yan, allow me to fight with you. Attacking a member of the younger generation does not show that you are capable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, Gu Lie, you, the Black Submerged King, has not improved much during these years!\u201d Hun Yan\u2019s expression was altered slightly ashe looked at the mountain like heavy figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack Submerged King? The Black Submerged Army top general? This Gu clan does indeed have many experts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled as he looked at the back of the figure in front of him. He had never seen this person in the Gu clan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung friend Xiao Yan, I will leave Gu Yang to you. You must snatch back the ancient jade!\u201d The Black Submerged King swayed in the wind. He spoke in a deep voice without turning back. After which, he stepped forward and directly engage in an intense battle with Hun Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. He did not have the energy to pay attention to the fight between those two. Turning around, he looked at Gu Yang, who was in a terrible state, with a cold smile. Xun Er and the rest had also encircled around him and completely surrounded him.</p><br/><p>Gu Yang watched the encirclement around him. A ferocious expression suddenly flashed over his face. He stepped on the air and his body actually rushed towards the energy barrier in the sky. Xiao Yan\u2019s face turned cold after seeing that this person was actually planning to force his way in. Hot flame whistled out from him and smashed onto Gu Yang\u2019s body with lightning like speed. Blood and flesh scattered immediately.</p><br/><p>Gu Yang\u2019s body was covered with blood after facing the intense attack from Xiao Yan\u2019s group. However, the ferocity and craziness on his face became increasingly intense. His seemingly crippled like body was still a thousand feet from the barrier when it actually began to swell rapidly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is about to self-destruct!\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of Xiao Yan\u2019s group changed immediately upon seeing this scene. The self-destruct from an advance five star Dou Sheng had quite a powerful force. Everyone quickly slowed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yang\u2019s body had swiftly exploded apart while Xiao Yan\u2019s group had reduced their speed. A frightening uncontrolled violent assault shattered the energy barrier in the blink of an eye. Energy raged and a blood glow suddenly shot out. After which, they rushed towards the few battlegrounds in the sky in a crazy manner!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ancient jade is inside. Stop him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s sharp eyes immediately saw a palm sized crystal clear ancient jade being wrapped within the blood glow. It was surprisingly the Tou She Ancient God Jade from the Gu clan!</p><br/><p>That fellow had actually chose to self-destruct in order to deliver the ancient jade!</p><br/>\n</div>"}
