An unusually dense black glow erupted from all the holes on it. An instant later, it suddenly burst apart in front of numerous shocked gazes. Bang! The loud sound was like rolling-thunder that resounded across the mountain. An extremely frightening black-colored tide surged out in all directions from the illusionary human head that had burst apart like a volcanic eruption. Finally, it engulfed the entire area.</p><br/><p>The darkness this time around was extremely complete. The sun in the sky appeared to vanish from the sky at this moment. The entire world was suddenly filled with darkness.</p><br/><p>The darkness covered the land, causing everyone to voice their alarm. A moment later, numerous various colored Dou Qi erupted. However even with the help of the glow from the Dou Qi, one could merely see a radius of a couple of feet in this unusual world of darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden darkness caused a commotion to immediately break out on the open ground. A countless number of people let out an exclamation as panic spread at this very moment.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and the others on the treetop were also slightly surprised by the arrival of this sudden darkness. However, they swiftly recovered their calm a moment later. By relying on his outstanding Spiritual Perception, he knew that this strange black curtain was created from the spreading of Protector Wu\u2019s energy. As long as the energy scattered, the darkness would naturally automatically disappear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how teacher and Cai Lin are.\u201d Xiao Yan frowned intently as he looked at the dark empty sky. He clenched his fist tightly as an uneasiness gradually rose within his heart. From the looks of Protector Wu\u2019s actions, it appeared that he had taken out Yun Shan\u2019s spirit and caused it to self-destruct. The destructive strength from the self-destruction of the spirit of an elite Dou Zong\u2026 Xiao Yan\u2019s body could not help but tremble a little as he thought about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid this fellow create such a large activity just to create such a black curtain?\u201d Hai Bodong\u2019s body was covered by a layer of white Dou Qi as he stood beside Xiao Yan. The faint Dou Qi glow covered a ten-foot-radius around him. His brows were knit as he looked all around him, and he inquired in a soft doubtful voice.</p><br/><p>Jia Xing Tian and the others by the side also nodded slightly when they heard his voice. They also did not sense some overly powerful energy erupting other than this strange black curtain\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fellow has caused Yun Shan\u2019s spirit to self-destruct. The main attacking target of the spiritual ripple from that explosion should be Medusa and Xiao Yan\u2019s teacher. Hence, we are unable to sense much of it.\u201d Fa Ma frowned. Being an alchemist, he was naturally extremely sensitive to this kind of unusual invisible spiritual ripples. Other people might not be able to sense it but he could vaguely discover that an unusually frightening energy ripple was gradually surging and brewing in a certain part of the dark sky.</p><br/><p>The expressions of Hai Bodong and the others changed slightly upon hearing Fa Ma\u2019s words. The Dou Qi in their bodies swiftly galloped. They were on alert for any spiritual ripple that could erupt at any moment.</p><br/><p>An unusual awful sound suddenly resounded across the sky while the few people spoke.</p><br/><p>This sound was quite soft and was impossible for an ordinary person to detect it. However, it was like a thunderous roar in Xiao Yan\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed drastically as he lifted his head in an abrupt fashion upon sensing the terrifying spiritual ripple that was contained in the sound. His gaze stared intently at a certain part in the sky. However, he was unable to see anything under this dark sky curtain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a furious curse when his observations were futile. He tightly knit his brows, and his heart suddenly moved a moment later. A thread of dark green flame flowed along his veins before leaping into both of his eyes, turning those dark-black pupils into fire eyes against the background.</p><br/><p>When the \u2018Glazed Lotus Core Flame\u2019 surfaced in both eyes, the darkness which one\u2019s sight could not penetrate began to slowly scatter. A world that carried a hint of jade-green appeared in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze instantly paused on a certain spot in the sky the moment the darkness disappeared. A paleness gradually surfaced on his face.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao and Medusa were standing in the distant sky within the darkness together. At the moment, the situation of the two was not good. The latter was a little better but the former\u2019s originally illusionary body had become increasingly more transparent.</p><br/><p>Protector Wu stood in the sky not far away, opposite the both of them. His shriveled hand was suspended on a cluster of large black light. A frightening Spiritual Strength agglomerated within the cluster of light. This somewhat familiar Spiritual Strength was the one erupted when Yun Shan\u2019s spirit self-destructed. At this moment, this Spiritual Strength that was born from the self-destruction was completely controlled by Protector Wu.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan\u2019s sight was able to see through this darkness, it seemed that this black sky curtain had even isolated the distant sound. Hence, Xiao Yan was uncertain if there was any conversation between the three. He could only see that the face of Protector Wu had turned savage after the three of them faced off for an instant. The enormous dark-black spiritual energy was lifted high up. Both of his palms pushed forward, and immediately the frightening spiritual energy became like a black-colored falling star as it flew through the sky and rushed toward Medusa and Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>The dark-black spiritual cluster drew through the air. Despite being a great distance from it, Xiao Yan could still sense an extremely strong spiritual pressure.</p><br/><p>This spiritual pressure that had suddenly appeared was also sensed by Hai Bodong and the others. However, they were unable to see through this darkness like Xiao Yan. Hence, they could only exclaim, \u201cWhat happened? Are they fighting above?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a frightening spiritual pressure.\u201d A paleness surfaced on Fa Ma\u2019s face. He discovered that under this spiritual pressure, his Spiritual Perception was completely suppressed within his body and was unable to seep out.</p><br/><p>The enormous spiritual energy cluster suddenly appeared in front of the solemn-faced Medusa and Yao Lao while everyone was quietly shocked. It did not pause for even a moment before it violently smashed down. That frightening ripple shook the space until it trembled.</p><br/><p>Poison! The wild and violent spiritual energy smashed into Medusa and Yao Lao who were unable to dodge it. Although the energy on the surface of their body was unleashed to the maximum, how could it be easy to deal with the force of an elite Dou Zong\u2019s spirit who self-destructed?</p><br/><p>The seven colored energy and the dense white flame erupted forth, and tried their best to block the corrosion of the wild, violent spiritual energy. However, after merely a moment, the dark-black spiritual strength soared and forcefully pressed the majestic energy that swarmed out of the bodies of the two back into them! Gurg! The seven colored energy swiftly disappeared. A paleness also surfaced on Medusa\u2019s face. A moment later, her face turned red and a mouthful of fresh blood was uncontrollably spat out. Her body swiftly withdrew.</p><br/><p>Medusa was able to withdraw in one piece but Yao Lao who was currently quite weak did not have such an ability. Moreover, the spiritual energy from the self-destruction had an unusually great amount of damage on this kind of spirit without the protection of physical flesh. Hence, that unusual black glow immediately poured onto his body like floodwater the moment the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 protection in front of him scattered.</p><br/><p>After Yao Lao\u2019s body received such a heavy blow, it nearly became as invisible as water. Clearly, this blow had truly caused Yao Lao to be seriously wounded. Moreover, Xiao Yan could also sense that Yao Lao\u2019s aura was becoming increasingly weaker.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, Yao Chen, this protector said that it would be difficult for you to escape from my hands today!\u201d Protector Wu\u2019s dark, dense laughter immediately sounded from the enormous black curtain when he saw Yao Lao\u2019s spiritual body become almost transparent. His body flashed and instantly appeared at a spot not far from Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>The face of the withdrawing Medusa changed slightly upon seeing this action of Protector Wu. Her body moved and rushed toward the latter in a lightning-like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Protector Wu let out a cold snort when Medusa\u2019s body had just moved. The seal in his hand changed and the black cloud around Medusa immediately began to wiggle in a strange manner. The space became swiftly distorted as it blocked the former rushing over.</p><br/><p>Protector Wu was aided by the black curtain in blocking Medusa. A black glow suddenly surfaced on Protector Wu\u2019s shriveled hand. Immediately, a ghost-like claw grabbed toward Yao Lao\u2019s spirit which had already become transparent.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s transparent body fluctuated slightly as he sensed the sinister ripple what was about to arrive. After which, it revealed a deeply frowning old face.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao shifted his gaze down while this thought swiftly flashed in his heart. His gaze appeared to have seen through the darkness as it looked at the pale-faced black-robed, young man in the treetop. He gave a calm smile and a wisp of white fire suddenly shot out explosively from between his eyebrows. Finally, it rushed through the sky in a lightning-like manner and entered Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, perhaps teacher is unable to continue accompanying you by your side in the future. You will have to rely on yourself for everything in the future. Ke ke, after so many years, you are also no longer the little boy from back then who needed his teacher to always accompany him. In the future, you will walk even further than what teacher expects\u2026 hopefully, I will be able to see that day.\u201d</p><br/><p>A gentle, old voice suddenly sounded in Xiao Yan\u2019s head as the flame rushed into his forehead.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body immediately trembled intensely upon hearing these words. His teeth bit his lower lip tightly. The scene that he really did not wish to see had finally appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, teacher will not die so easily. This fire glow is the essence of the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019. I will leave it on your forehead. Once you are familiar with it, you will also be able to use the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019. However, due to me having refined it long before, your \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 will not be able to swallow and refine it. Of course, if I really end up meeting a misfortune one day, the fire seal on your forehead will automatically disappear. The \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 will become an item with no owner. At that time, you can treat it as the last gift that teacher has given you and swallow it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, additionally, the ring that I hid my spirit in is called the \u2018Bone Flame Ring\u2019. There is a solution to resolve the \u2018Life Devouring Pill\u2019 issue of your second brother and some of the things that I have left behind. Moreover, if you end up meeting my old friend Feng zun-zhe, you can show this ring to him. He will believe all that you say\u2026 and will also help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: zun-zhe - respectful form of address for a Dou Zun</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I have fallen into the hands of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019, it will not be an easy matter for them to refine my spirit. Perhaps we will have the opportunity to meet again. However, you should remember not to act rashly before you have the ability. You cannot meet with the slightest accident if you want to rescue teacher and your father!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, little fellow, you are the student that this teacher is most proud of. I have always been extremely satisfied with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gentle laugh slowly disappeared within Xiao Yan\u2019s head and a white-colored fire seal gradually surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead</p><br/><p>Protector Wu\u2019s hand claw suddenly penetrated Yao Lao\u2019s body just as the fire seal was formed. A black glow surged and a dark laugh forcefully absorbed everything into a cluster of black fog!</p><br/>\n</div>"}
