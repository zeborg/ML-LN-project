Each type of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 on this ranking list caused a countless number of people to flock over in doves. Any little news that was related to them would stir up an extremely big commotion. This point had already been proven many times over by many events.</p><br/><p>Each of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 on the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019 had their own unique properties. Of course, just like how people had long and short hands, the \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 naturally had those that were stronger and those that were weaker when they were compared with each other. The first kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that Xiao Yan had was the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 which was ranked nineteenth on the ranking list. On top of possessing an extremely wild and violently high temperature, this kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 seemed to also be able to ignite a volcanic eruption. Of course, until now, Xiao Yan had never done something like this. Hence, he was also unaware of whether this was really true.</p><br/><p>The second \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 he possessed was naturally the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 which was ranked fourteenth. This kind of invisible flame was similar to the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 in terms of strength. However, it was superior in its bizarre uses. Of course, it also possessed a unique ability that caused one\u2019s eyes to turn red with envy. That was the ability to help people refine the Dou Qi in their body to increase their training speed.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had learned of the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019, the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 with the highest ranking that Xiao Yan had seen was the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 of Yao Lao, which was ranked eleventh on the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019. This thing was far more powerful than Xiao Yan\u2019s two \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 in terms of destructive strength. Perhaps only the \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019 that was formed from the merger of these two \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 could contend with it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had never seen any \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 ranked above that flame He was completely unaware of the names of those \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 and the special abilities that they possessed.</p><br/><p>The eleventh ranked \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 already possessed such a frightening, destructive strength. It was difficult to imagine just how frightening the strength of the third ranked \u2018Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame\u2019.</p><br/><p>According to what Yao Lao had said back then, this \u2018Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame\u2019 was something that even he had never seen. There was no rumors of anyone having possessed this kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 during these many years. A flame at this level seemed to basically be nonexistent. Xiao Yan really did not know just how the person who recorded the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019 had obtained news of these mysterious \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 and was able to rank their names from there.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had occasionally heard Yao Lao mention that the top five \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 of this \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019 were actually those kinds of things where one had only heard of but never seen. At the very least, he had never seen or heard any information that was related to the top five \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 during his era. Back then, he was extremely proud of his own strength. Originally, he had planned to obtain a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that was ranked within the top five in order to be worthy of his status and position. In the end, after spending endless amounts of time and plenty of effort, he had failed to obtain a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 within the top ten, much less within the top five. Finally, he could only settle for a lower grade. He chose the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 that was ranked eleventh. Even though this was the case, he had nearly suffered from a backlash while he was obtaining the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019. From this, one could tell that the \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 on the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019 were indeed not things that were easy to find.</p><br/><p>Back then, Yao Lao was so astonished when he had obtained the first fragmented map piece from the cave and identified just what the black lotus was. Who would have thought that the thing he had waited for so long without the slightest clue about would actually appear in such a secluded mountain cave.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face also let out a sigh as his heart recalled all the issues related to the \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019. He immediately leaped down from his bed and came to the side of the table. After which, he began to carefully join the ancient yellowish map fragments.</p><br/><p>Some of the lines that were drawn on the map gradually began to merge as the maps were joined together. However, some of the things that were drawn on it left Xiao Yan completely clueless. Given his experience, he was totally unable to identify just where the location that was drawn on the map was.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hand gently caressed the map. His eyes landed on an empty corner. According to his guess, this map should have four parts. Currently, he already had three parts of it in his hands. If he was able to obtain the final piece of the map, he might be able to obtain the location of the \u2018Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame!\u2019</p><br/><p>Although\u2026 his words were spoken in this manner, this Dou Qi continent was spacious. The difficulty of attempting to obtain the final map fragment was not much lower than finding a needle in a haystack. Moreover, it was obvious that one could not find something like this openly. There were many experts on the Dou Qi continent and it was different from the secluded existence of the Jia Ma Empire where an ordinary person did not know what the map fragment was. Hence, should anyone discover that he possessed a clue to find the \u2018Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame,\u2019 it was likely that he would attract an endless amount of trouble.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily let out a bitter laugh when he thought of this. The reason that he was able to obtain three pieces of the map fragments was because of luck. It was easier said than done if he wanted to go and get hold of another piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I have very little knowledge of the Dou Qi continent, and I am completely unaware of just what news is out there. I am basically clueless in my attempt to find the last remaining map fragment\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan mused to himself. \u201cIt seems that at the very least I will need to look for a trustworthy person who also understands the Dou Qi continent well in order to obtain some news\u2026 however, Cai Lin and the Little Fairy Doctor do not have a better understanding of the continent compared to me despite them being trustworthy. Ugh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s finger gently tapped the table\u2019s surface. He descended into deep thought. This continued for quite a while before his finger suddenly paused. A joy surfaced within his heart as he stood up and softly laughed, \u201cHow could I have forgotten about First Elder Su Qian? Being the First Elder of the Jia Nan Academy\u2019s Inner Academy, it was likely that this esteem elder should be aware of many secrets given the special position that the Jia Nan Academy had on the continent. Looking for him should be the best choice if Xiao Yan wanted to find some news relating to the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, even if I am unable to obtain news about the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, it is rumored that the headmaster of the Inner Academy is also an elite Dou Zun comparable to teacher. If I am able to meet him this time around, it might be possible to invite him to lend a hand regarding this \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 given his relationship with the Inner Academy\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes flickered. He immediately sigh in relief. He had left the Inner Academy for more than a year. It was likely that the incomplete \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 that he had left behind in the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 had already been exhausted. If he did not go and help them replenish it, it was likely that the First Elder would become anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I will have to hurry over to the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 after settling the matters here\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan laughed softly as he muttered to himself. The \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 was close to the middle of the Dou Qi continent. The chances of obtaining news about a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 at that place were far higher than staying within the Jia Ma Empire. Therefore, Xiao Yan might have to plan another trip back there.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart relaxed after having made this decision. He carefully stored the map on the table into his storage ring. With a wave of his sleeves, the flame light in the room was extinguished, and a quiet darkness covered the room.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou plan to head to the \u2018Black-Corner Region?\u201d Medusa inquired with some surprised. She was startled when she heard Xiao Yan\u2019s plans.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He said, \u201cThe headmaster of the Inner Academy is an elite Dou Zun. If I am able to meet him, I might be able to ask him to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi, that old fellow is always missing. In all my years at the Inner Academy, I have only seen him once. Even if you go, you might not be able to meet him.\u201d Zi Yan by the side curled her mouth when she replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must at least give it a try, right? Moreover, even if I am unable to meet him, I will also be able to inquire about some information relating to the \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 from the First Elder. If I am able to find another type of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, I will not need anyone\u2019s help in undoing this \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019.\u201d Xiao Yan vaguely smiled in an unconcerned manner as he responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, there is more trouble in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 than within the Jia Ma Empire. Do you need me to follow?\u201d Medusa mused for a moment before nodding her head and asking a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough you will be of much help if you follow me, the Yan Alliance and the Snake-People Tribe will no longer be guaranteed their safety should you leave. Hence, I can only trouble you to help me protect the Yan Alliance and the members of the Xiao clan this time around.\u201d Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before speaking with a solemn expression. The people from the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 seemed to have not given up their plans for the Xiao clan. If all of them left, it was likely that the members of the Xiao clan would be in danger should the people from the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 make their way to the Jia Ma Empire, which did not have the protection of an elite Dou Zong.</p><br/><p>Medusa knit her brows when she heard this. She was not really reassure, especially allowing Xiao Yan to head to the danger-filled \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 alone. However, what Xiao Yan had said was true. The current Yan Alliance needed the presence of an elite Dou Zong\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I accompany you? The Poison Sect no longer has any opponents within the Chu Yun Empire. It should not be much trouble for me to leave for a period of time.\u201d The quiet Little Fairy Doctor by the side suddenly suggested when she saw the worry on Medusa\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled. He immediately became somewhat hesitant. He would naturally gain a lot of advantages if an elite Dou Zong like the Little Fairy Doctor followed him. However, she did have an enormous Poison Sect to manage\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMy \u2018Woeful Poison Body\u2019 might erupt any time. If you leave for too long, who will come and help me control it even if all the ingredients have been found?\u2019 The Little Fairy Doctor involuntarily smiled and continued to explain when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 alright. Thank you very much.\u201d Xiao Yan naturally ceased hesitating since the other party had spoken to such an extent. He immediately nodded, cupped his hands, and smiled to the Little Fairy Doctor. He naturally understood that the Little Fairy Doctor had the intention of protecting him by following him.</p><br/><p>Medusa quietly sighed in relief when she saw that the Little Fairy Doctor had taken the initiative to say that she would follow Xiao Yan. The gaze she used to look at the latter was slightly gentler. She clearly knew that the Little Fairy Doctor possessed a strength that was similar to hers. Xiao Yan should not have too much trouble with her tagging along.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me take this little girl too. I must at least let First Elder and the others see that I did not mistreat her since I will also be returning to the Jia Nan Academy.\u201d Xiao Yan patted Zi Yan\u2019s head only to end up being dodged by the unwilling girl.</p><br/><p>Medusa faintly smiled and nodded. Although Zi Yan\u2019s strength was only that of a Dou Huang, that frightening strange strength of hers was something that even an expert Dou Huang would have difficulty contending against. She could also be considered quite the help.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, when will you be leaving?\u201d Medusa looked at Xiao Yan as she slowly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will leave tomorrow. Now\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. He immediately flicked his finger and a jade bottle with an invisible flame sealing its mouth appeared in his hand. He looked at the jade bottle. Some coldness flashed across his eyes as he slowly said, \u201cNow, we should pry some information regarding the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 from this fellow\u2019s mouth.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}
