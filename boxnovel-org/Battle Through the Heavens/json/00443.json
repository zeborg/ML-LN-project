He also smiled at the number on the dark, black crystal card, which had jumped up once more. Currently, his Fire Crystal Card stored a full seventy-four days worth of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 within it. If he were to count, it appeared that this amount of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 was sufficient for him to train for over two months in the \u2018Sky Flame Qi Training Tower.\u2019 This could be considered a plentiful harvest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdding this group, we should have collected from five groups by now.\u201d Xun Er returned her crystal card properly. She took one glance at the five people, who were tied to the tree trunk after they were knocked out and continued happily, \u201cOther than the two groups known as the \u2018Black White Evil Stopper\u2019, we can still snatch from the other three groups.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt a pity that this forest is so large. It might become difficult to locate the last three groups within it. Once we expose our whereabouts, it is likely that those groups will all hurry over to surround and cut us off. Although our cooperation is much better after those two days of special training, we can only handle one group at a time. Two groups would be our limit. If there were three, we would definitely be defeated.\u201d Hu Jia voiced her thoughts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned slightly. A moment later, his gaze swept across the five new students, who were still standing in the middle of the empty ground, in a stunned state. His heart suddenly moved as he slowly said, \u201cCurrently, there are only three older student groups, not including the \u2018Black White Evil Stopper,\u2019 who still have the qualifications to participate in this Hunting Competition. In other words, there are still fifteen people. Yet, us new students don\u2019t have the restriction where we lose qualification to participate if our \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 is less than ten. Therefore, I think that there should be quite a lot of new students who are still wandering around within this forest, right? After all, this forest is too big. They don\u2019t have a route to follow, so they would have great difficulty successfully leaving the forest within such a short time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d The four of them were startled when they heard Xiao Yan\u2019s words. Bai Shan knit his eyebrows and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cGather all the new students together. After that, let news slip to attract the other three groups. Use the strength of all the new students to finish them off altogether. What do you think?\u201d Xiao Yan said fainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttract all of them over? That means all three groups will be attacking us. What if the other new students are unable to successfully block them? Won\u2019t this be similar to a goat entering the tiger\u2019s lair?\u201d Bai Shan\u2019s expression immediately changed a little when he heard this extremely bold suggestion from Xiao Yan. They needed to use tacit cooperation in order to just defeat one group. If it were three groups, the one who would lose would definitely be them. He did not want to give the \u2018Fire Energy,\u201d which he had snatched with great difficulty, to someone else.</p><br/><p>TL; a goat entering the tiger\u2019s lair - seek death</p><br/><p>\u201cThat may not be true. If there is a sufficiently large number of new students, we will definitely be able to gain the advantage. Don\u2019t look down on the other new students. Their strength is definitely not weak if they are able to enter the top fifty. It is just due to the lack of cooperation between them that they collapse after receiving a single blow from the older students.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, we cannot continue to drag things out like this. Finding an opportunity to finish all of them off in one go would save us a lot of trouble. Don\u2019t you all want to quickly head to the Inner Academy and witness this \u2018Sky Flame Qi Training Tower?\u2019\u201d Xiao Yan spread his hands and questioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we have already spent three or four days within this forest. It is not a solution to continue dragging it out.\u201d Wu Hao nodded and replied in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine with anything. At the very most, we will just have to return the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 that we\u2019ve obtained.\u201d Hu Jia curled her lips. She faced Xiao Yan and said, \u201cNow, you are already the group leader. You can just decide on these matters alone. There is no need to be overly sensitive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head when he heard this. This action of his, to obtain opinions from his companions, had been criticized as being overly sensitive.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, alright. I will listen to you once more. Hopefully, you don\u2019t ruin it.\u201d Seeing that Wu Hao and Hu Jia did not have any objections, Bai Shan could only nod his head. He clearly knew that in this group, Xiao Yan already had credibility that caused Hu Jia and Wu Hao to be convinced in their hearts after these two days of fighting together. Moreover, Xun Er always agreed with everything that he said. Therefore, Bai Shan\u2019s words were basically something that was dispensable in this group. Who let him be in a position where he had few supporters?</p><br/><p>Seeing that the opinions were once again unanimous, Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He mused for a moment before suddenly turning toward the other five students. With a smile, he walked over and flipped his palm. A couple of healing medicines appeared in his hand, which he then handed over. \u201cAre you guys alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Xiao Yan, thank you very much for lending us a hand. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to escape from being beaten into pig heads today.\u201d A young man, who appeared to be the leader, spoke with a face filled with gratitude. He was somewhat excited when he received the healing medicine, which Xiao Yan handed over.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, we are all new students. We ought to support one another.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed indifferently. His gaze stared at them as he suddenly asked, \u201cDo you want to help us retaliate against those fellows?\u201d</p><br/><p>The five new students were startled when they heard this. They naturally understood that the \u2018those fellows\u2019 that Xiao Yan had just mentioned referred to the older students from the Inner Academy that were participating in the Hunting Competition. After hesitating for a moment, they grit their teeth and nodded. During these past two days, they had endured quite a lot of those fellows hopelessly stupid anger, but they only dared to be angry and did not dare to say anything due to the difference in their strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that is the case, I would like you all to help me with something.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Xiao Yan has rescued us once, just tell us what needs to be done.\u201d When he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s words, a young man hurriedly pounded his chest and basically agreed without any hesitation. His companions beside him also nodded with faces that were filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>Seeing that this small group of people had agreed in such a straightforward manner, Xiao Yan was also startled. Perhaps even he himself did not know how deep of an impression he had left within this batch of new students when he lead his group to hunt down the older students. Most of the current new students already viewed Xiao Yan as an idol which they worshipped within their hearts. It was not for any other reason besides him having the strength and courage to contend against those older students who had bullied them.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, in that case, thank you very much\u2026 It\u2019s like this, I want to ask you to try your best to spread out and search for other new students within the forest. After which, tell them that if they want to regain all the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 that they have lost and that if they trust me, they can all gather at this place. I will lead them in a ruthless battle against those arrogant Inner Academy students!\u201d Xiao Yan cupped his hands toward them and asked softly, \u201cMay I know if the few of you will agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Coincidentally, we are communicating with some of the new students. As they were worried of being captured by the older students, many of them have already hidden themselves.\u201d A fiery heat swarmed on the five new students face. They had been led by Xiao Yan\u2019s words until their hot blood was boiling. After so many days of being bullied and suppressed, they were now finally able to retaliate. How could they not be excited?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the few of you should take advantage of this opportunity. Additionally, if you were to meet the older student groups alone during the journey, you should first hand over your \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 to them. I, Xiao Yan, will compensate the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 which you have lost after this is over.\u201d Xiao Yan sighed in his heart as he reminded these five people.</p><br/><p>The five new students nodded their heads when they heard this. They immediately cupped their hands toward Xiao Yan and said, \u201cSenior Xiao Yan can just wait for us to bring the other new students over. As long as you are leading us, we dare to follow you to retaliate against those bastards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once they said that, the five of them swiftly separated. Under Xiao Yan\u2019s focus, they swiftly entered into the dense forest and disappeared between the moving tree leaves.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, it\u2019s settled. Next, let\u2019s wait for the rest of the new students to gather. Once everyone has been gathered, our absolute grand retaliation will begin!\u201d Xiao Yan stood up, turned around and smiled as he spoke to Xun Er and the three others.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because they had the hope of retaliating against the older students of the Inner Academy, but the efficiency of the five new students was so outstanding that it caused Xiao Yan to be somewhat astonished. In merely one morning, there were new students carefully appearing around this clearing one after another. Only when they saw that the the ones seated cross-legged between the trees and resting were Xiao Yan\u2019s five man group were they completely convinced. After which, human figures began to flash within the quiet forest. One by one, miserable-looking figures landed and entered into this empty space. When their gazes swept across the five older students, who were tied to a tree trunk by Xiao Yan, the hatred which had accumulated in their hearts for two to three days finally began to ease up.</p><br/><p>These new students agglomerated here from various locations and were extremely conscious, not daring to interrupt Xiao Yan\u2019s five man group, who were training with their eyes closed. One by one, they formed a circular shape, surrounding Xiao Yan\u2019s five men group.</p><br/><p>As time passed, more and more new students came flashing out successively from the dense forest toward this empty ground. Their gazes involuntarily gathered on the black-robed young man in the middle of the encirclement, carrying a faint heated worshipful feeling within them.</p><br/><p>At a certain instance, Xiao Yan, who had his eyes shut, finally opened them slowly. He eyed the the surrounding new students, who were seated cross-legged in an orderly manner around him with sparkling eyes. A gratified smile surfaced on his face. This number did not disappoint him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, do you want to return the grievances that you endured these past two days due to those self-righteous Inner Academy\u2019s older students?\u201d Xiao Yan slowly released his pent up breath and his voice suddenly sounded among the trees.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Orderly low furious voices shook the tree leaves on the trees around them.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly as he eyed the fury and resentment that swarmed onto the faces of the new students. What he wanted was this fury that had agglomerated into anger!</p><br/><p>The tree branches between the trees suddenly moved. Two or three human figures flashed out. There were instantly dozens of gazes jumping over from the open ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Xiao Yan, we did as you asked and exposed our position to the other three groups. Now, they are likely hurrying to this place!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clapped his hands together heavily. He suddenly stood up and his gaze looked around at the new students, whose eyes were filled with fury, despite their miserable appearance. In a deep voice, he said, \u201cEveryone, hide yourselves properly. Today, we will give those haughty older students a ruthless slap!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xiao Yan\u2019s voice fell, nearly forty students immediately began entering the dense brush around them in an agile manner. In just the blink of an eye, the originally crowded open ground had once again become empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, prepare yourselves. We need to finish them off in one blow.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and reminded Xun Er and the three others.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>On top of a huge tree somewhere in the dense forest, two old men were sitting cross-legged there with open eyes. They looked at one another. A soft laughter slowly reverberated through the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, it\u2019s going to get lively now!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}
