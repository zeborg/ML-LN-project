A strange fog spread from the emptiness as a sound wave vaguely spread across the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world tide\u2026 it is indeed the same as what was stated on the ancient map.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly stood up on the top of the tree. He lifted his head, looked at the faint fog that covered the land, and muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>A couple rays of light swiftly rushed over from the star realm while Xiao Yan was muttering to himself. They appeared beside Xiao Yan in a couples of flashes. These rays of light were Yao Lao\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe demonic flame is about to descend on the world\u2026\u201d Yao Lao landed beside Xiao Yan and spoke in a grave voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. Countless experts would be rushing to location of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame from tomorrow on. Even though many people knew that they did not possess the ability to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, all of them would adopt a hopeful attitude. After all, anyone who could obtain the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame and refine it would undoubtedly experience a great leap in strength. At that time, one would even be able to easily win against an expert who far surpassed one\u2019s strength. That temptation was just too much to resist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen shall we get moving?\u201d Yao Lao asked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment upon hearing this question. His expression suddenly changed just before he could speak. He suddenly lifted his head as he looked at the night sky to the north-west. An intense light was emitted from the distant sky at that moment. This light contained an extremely terrifying temperature. It spread like a wave and reached an unbelievably large area. It was still possible for one to feel a heat rising within one\u2019s heart within the Falling Star Pavilion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame has appeared in this world.\u201d Yao Lao sensed this unusual phenomenon. He inhaled a gentle breath of cool air. He had not expected this demonic flame to break its seal with such anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hand gently pressed on his forehead. The mysterious light cluster suspended in his head had once again formed an intense ripple at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan exhaled a long breath of air. A thought passed through his mind as he gradually suppressed the unusual movements of the light cluster. With his Perfect Heavenly State Spiritual Strength, he might not be able to enter the cluster of light, but it was not much of a problem for him to suppress it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will leave now. Regardless of what the situation is like, we should head over to take a look before deciding what to do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan spoke in a deep voice. His eyes flashed after suppressing that light cluster. The speed at which the demonic flame had appeared was much faster than he had anticipated. It was likely that various experts were beginning to hurry over. Xiao Yan\u2019s group needed to swiftly reach that place. Even if they did not intend to act immediately, it would be best to gain a clear view of the situation as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao was startled, but he did not say anything more. A long whistle was emitted from his mouth. That whistle spread over the well-lit star realm as many figures began to hurriedly fly over from various parts of it. Finally, they floated in the sky. The people right in front of this group was the First Elder of the Small Pill Tower, Ancestor Huo Yun, and the Flower Sect\u2019s Fairy Qing and Fairy Hua\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis trip is extremely critical. I already invited them over two days ago\u2026\u201d Yao Lao smiled as he informed Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan titled his in acknowledgement. At this moment, each additional person was more strength, meaning an additional chance of success.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, this trip is fraught with danger. If anyone meets with danger that you are no match for, please withdraw. The most important thing is to preserve one\u2019s strength.\u201d Xiao Yan spoke in a deep voice. The experts present were considered the elite forces of the alliance. If their losses were too great, it would severely hurt the core of the alliance. Snatching the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame might be important, but there was no need for unnecessary sacrifices in order to obtain it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The many human figures in the sky cried out in unison upon hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s orders. Xiao Yan\u2019s strength and reputation within the alliance was not inferior to Yao Lao\u2019s prestige. No one dared to go against his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not utter any unnecessary words upon hearing them agree. He waved his hand and his body turned into a ray of light that swiftly rushed out of the star realm. After which, they rushed toward the location where the demonic flame had appeared with lightning-like speed. A large group shot through the sky behind them.</p><br/><p>Large groups of people were flying from various sects and factions across the Central Plains while the Falling Star Pavilion was maneuvering their people. After which, every group was accompanied by the buzzing sound of rushing wind as they flew through the sky a batch at a time. Their destination was the north-western region of the Central Plains.</p><br/><p>Within a short night, the entire Central Plains had turned into a mess\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The loud sound of wind being split suddenly blew across the sky as a large group of people flew over from the distant horizon.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are entering the area five hundred kilometers from where the demonic flame has appeared\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan lifted his head. His eyes observed the distant area in front. A glaring light was being emitted like a dazzling sun in that direction. Wave after wave of terrifying heat came pouncing over as they approached. Even though those present in this trip were all extremely strong individuals, many of them were still covered in perspiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed worthy of being the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Just the heat that is being emitted will make it difficult for six star and above elite Dou Zuns to resist\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept over the people behind him. His brow was involuntarily knit. A six star elite Dou Zun could be considered a top tier expert across the continent. However, this strength was barely able to resist the remnant heat of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. From this heat, one could tell just how terrifying the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, we have met at least ten groups along the way. Their aim is clearly the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. It seems like there will be an earth-shaking fight over it this time around.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s pretty eyes swept around her as she spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. They had indeed met quite a number of groups with the same intentions along the way, but he did not pay much attention to them. Although those people were quite strong, they were still a little too weak to snatch the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder whether the Hun clan and the other ancient clans have already reached\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes scanned the area far in front of him as this thought flashed through his heart. He once again waved his hand and cried out in a deep voice, \u201cIncrease our speed\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The five hundred kilometer distance could be covered by experts like Xiao Yan within a couple of minutes. Although there was a large group delaying him, the entire group gradually reached the mountainous region where the demonic flame had descended around twenty minutes later. The lush green mountain range had completely vanished. Only a cream-white desert remained. A terrifying heat radiated from the ground, causing the area within a five-hundred-kilometer radius to reveal a distortion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a terrifying flame this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is. It has actually incinerated such an enormous mountain range into a desert\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao involuntarily inhaled a breath of cool air as he looked at the enormous desert that appeared in front of him. His face was filled with shock.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. A flame surged from his body and wrapped around everyone from the alliance. Only then was the searing pain on his skin reduced. After which, he lifted his head and looked at the distant sky. That area had already been split apart. A cream-white light broke from the space and poured down. The light emitted a terrifying temperature that even the soul was unable to endure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe space that sealed the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame has already been broken. However, the demonic flame has not appeared. It is probably still in that realm. This cream-white light is merely its lingering heat\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan softly explained after seeing this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cLingering heat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with Zi Yan\u2019s strength, her face involuntarily changed upon hearing these words. A little lingering heat was able to incinerate the mountain range and turn it into a desert. Just how frightening would it be if they entered that realm?</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh swoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after Xiao Yan\u2019s group appeared in this desert, waves of the sound of rushing wind were transmitted from every direction. Numerous figures came to a halt far from that broken space. Their eyes contained some horror as they stared at this cream-white desert. They were aware that this place had originally been a mountainous region that had been filled with life before this night\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the looks of it, it seems that we must enter that realm in order to obtain the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame\u2026\u201d Yao Lao stared at the space above for a long time before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to hurry. This realm is fraught with all sorts of danger. We are not qualified to be the first to step forward\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head. Even he could sense an immense danger. If this group of theirs were to hastily enter, hardly any of them would be able to escape alive\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Lao nodded. Being an alchemist, he was naturally able to detect just how frightening it would be within that broken space.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The space near them suddenly fluctuated while Xiao Yan\u2019s group carefully waited. A dense black fog seeped out in all directions from this fluctuation. A frightening aura that caused one\u2019s expression to alter, quietly spread. It immediately attracted all the eyes present.</p><br/><p>Many pairs of eyes glanced at the spot where the black fog had appeared. Finally, the black fog slowly scattered, and a couple of human figures appeared in front of everyone\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026 the chief of the Hall of Souls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s group narrowed their eyes as they looked at the black-robed human figure leading the group. That figure possessed a frightening aura. The Dou Qi within their bodies began to quietly circulate.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
