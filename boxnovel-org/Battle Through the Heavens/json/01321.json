They exchanged looks with one another and saw a horror that could not be hidden from each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat, how did he become so strong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Quan clenched his fist. His heart was filled with disbelief. Although he was aware that Xiao Yan had already surpassed him, he did not expect Xiao Yan to be able to defeat Yang Hao, whose strength was at the peak of the fifth star, in such an easy fashion.</p><br/><p>Being someone from the same clan, Ling Quan was well aware of Yang Hao\u2019s strength. Yang Hao possessed quite a number of powerful Dou Skills. He had even mastered the God Seal Skill to the Overturning Land Seal. With this strength, he would be hard pressed to find any opponent who could match him from the same level. However, from the looks of that battle earlier Yang Hao was completely suppressed by Xiao Yan until he was at a disadvantage. His ferocious attacks did not even harm Xiao Yan. Clearly, Xiao Yan\u2019s fighting strength had far surpassed his level on the surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, there really is a reason he caught the young miss\u2019s eyes. His strength is likely similar to big brother\u2026\u201d The fifth commander softly sighed.</p><br/><p>Ling Quan\u2019s expression became even more gloomy when he heard these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao, who was buried under the rock fragments of the building, struggled to climb out. Most of his clothes were in tatters. At a glance, he was charred-black. Fresh blood continued to seep from the corner of his mouth while he coughed.</p><br/><p>Yang Hao\u2019s hair scattered down from his head. His appearance was just like a mad demon. A pair of savage blood-red eyes glared at Xiao Yan. He had basically suffered a complete lose during this match. No matter how he thought about it, he could not understand how he had ended up being defeated in such a miserable manner by Xiao Yan, especially since he was at the peak of the fifth star of the Dou Zun strength and possessed many high class Dou Skills!</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard thing, I refuse to accept this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fury and embarrassment swelled within his heart. He was defeated in such a miserable manner in public. If word of this were to spread back to the Gu Realm, there was no telling just how much ridicule he would suffer. Immediately, Yang Hao became hot-headed. He let out a furious roar as his foot stomped on the ground. Enduring the intense pain that was being transmitted from all over his body, he turned into lightning that once again shot toward Xiao Yan on the stage.</p><br/><p>Quite a number of people frowned when they saw Yang Hao, who appeared to have suddenly lost his sense of reasoning. This fellow appeared to be without any grace.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were indifferent as he watched Yang Hao rush over. His foot suddenly stomped in front of him, and his ghost-like body appeared in front of Yang Hao. Xiao Yan\u2019s arm shook and a wave of sharp wind surged from nowhere, smashing into Yang Hao\u2019s chest in a lightning-like fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>After suffering another heavy blow, Yang Hao once again spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. His body flew backwards and shattered a couple of tables and chairs into dust.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, this Yang Hao is really a fool\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A person laughed softly from somewhere within the building when Yang Hao pounced at Xiao Yan like a madman.</p><br/><p>This spot was an isolated area. It was much quieter compared to the other places. There were four figures seated beside the table, consisting of three men and one woman. A burning flame mark was imprinted on the foreheads of these four individuals. At a glance, they appeared just like real flames, causing one to feel hot.</p><br/><p>The voice from earlier was emitted from the mouth of a somewhat gentle-looking man among the four of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this Xiao Yan is only a five star Dou Zun, his Dou Qi is naturally far from what an ordinary person can compare with since he is in possession of a Heavenly Flame. It is only natural for Yang Hao to be defeated by his hands.\u201d A middle-aged man with rough eyebrows on the opposite side faintly commented on the matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe still possesses an extremely powerful soul. Under his Spiritual Perception, ghost agility techniques are completely useless\u2026 that Yang Hao is too arrogant.\u201d The last man was wearing a white robe. His appearance was quite handsome. The corner of his mouth contained a slight smile which gave one a warm feeling.</p><br/><p>This man\u2019s eyes landed on the lady beside him after his words sounded. This lady was wearing a pale-red dress. A veil covered her face, but the outline that was revealed through the veil was still extremely alluring. Her bright eyes did not contain the slightest ripple. She also did not respond to the conversation between the three. It was as though everything had difficulty arousing her interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuo Zhi, can you not treat us as though we are non-existent?\u201d That white-clothed man involuntarily shook his head and spoke when he saw this manner of hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am interested in his Heavenly Flame.\u201d That red-clothed lady finally raised her head a little after hearing his words. She glanced at Xiao Yan on the stage. Her voice was cold and enchanting.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-clothed trio of men helplessly rolled their eyes when they heard what she said. They were just about to speak when the red-clothed lady suddenly said, \u201cIt is quite lively today. Looks like the members of the Gu clan don\u2019t really welcome Xiao Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood covered Yang Hao stared ferociously at Xiao Yan. His breathing was just like that of a bull. It was a long while later before he charged forward in a crazy manner. However, an ice-cold cry suddenly resounded within the wine shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cYang Hao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao\u2019s entire body suddenly trembled when he heard this cry. He actually recovered. His body stood on the spot as he clenched his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have completely embarrassed the Gu clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>A figure slowly appeared in front of Yang Hao after he stopped moving. The ice-cold voice caused fear to flash across Yang Hao\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Quan\u2019s duo were startled when they saw that figure. Joy immediately surged in the former\u2019s eyes. Their bodies rushed forward and appeared beside that figure before respectfully addressing him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>That figure glanced at the two of them. A cold cry sounded before his eyes suddenly shifted away. He stared at the skinny figure on the stage and asked in a deep voice, \u201cXiao Yan, do you enjoy beating others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked down at the figure from his vantage point. The figure was wearing pale-silver armor. Silver light flowed over his body as a mighty aura spread apart. Quite a number of people were giving it a sidelong glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just sparing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at the silver-armored man. The way Ling Quan addressed this person made it obvious that this figure should be that so-called second commander. This person should be a six star Dou Zun.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the silver-armored man narrowed upon hearing this. His body moved, and he appeared on the stone stage before speaking faintly, \u201cBlack Submerged Army second commander, Lin Xiu\u2026 since you like to spar this much, this commander shall come and give it a try. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is a tactic to take turns fighting me, it seems that you are lacking in numbers.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need for us to fight you one after another in order to deal with you\u2026\u201d Lin Xiu coldly laughed. Today, Yang Hao was publicly beaten by Xiao Yan until he was miserable. If he did not step forward, it was likely that others would think that the Black Submerged Army was only this mediocre.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you say? Xiao Yan, do you dare to receive another challenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf second commander insists, then please begin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan merely knit his brows before relaxing. Lin Xiu was trying to corner him. It seemed that the young geniuses of the Gu clan had developed a deep grudge against him. As the saying went, a serious illness required strong medicine. Since this was the case, he would use some strong medicine!</p><br/><p>Quite a number of people in the building shot their eyes over when they saw the tense swords-drawn atmosphere on the stage. At this moment, everyone could tell that these young geniuses of the Gu clan seemed to possess a hidden grudge against Xiao Yan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Xiu, all of you are making a farce!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, just when everyone thought that a battle was about to erupt, a furious elder\u2019s voice suddenly resounded. A gray-clothed figure appeared on the stone stage in a lightning-like manner and reprimanded Lin Xiu.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Gu Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Xiu was startled when he saw this gray-clothed elder suddenly appearing. He cupped his hands and respectfully said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense. As hosts, all of you are making things difficult for a guest of the Gu clan in public. Just how does this look? Aren\u2019t all of you withdrawing?\u201d The old man called Gu Xun glared at this group as he furiously scolded them.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiu did not dare to argue after being chided by Gu Xun. He understood that he could not recoup their lost face today since this old man appeared. All he could do was helplessly shake his head. His cold eyes slide to Xiao Yan while his mouth slightly moved. A weak voice was quietly transmitted into Xiao Yan\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, consider yourself lucky this time around. If you are sensible, you would leave the Gu clan as soon as possible. Otherwise, entering the Gu clan will only cause you to seek your own humiliation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression remained calm when he heard the voice beside his ear. A faint but cold smile appeared within his dark-black eyes.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiu did not dare to stay any longer after his voice sounded. He rushed down from the stage, grabbed Yang Hao, who was unable to even move, and strode out of the building.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun turned his head after watching Lin Xiu walk into the distant. His eyes were somewhat complicated as he looked at Xiao Yan. He softly said, \u201cA member of the Xiao clan has once again come to the Gu clan\u2026 young people tend to be impulsive. Due to the matter of young miss, you will probably meet many troubles in the future. Hopefully, you are prepared to meet them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan cupped his hands to Gu Xun, but he did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Gu Xun studied Xiao Yan in depth. After which, he turned around and stepped down from the stage before walking away from the building.</p><br/><p>Quite a number of people felt that they had not seen their fill when they watched the build up of a fierce battle end in such an abrupt manner. However, there was nothing they could do. They could only withdraw their eyes and softly discuss that intense battle earlier. Numerous eyes continuously swept toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was unconcerned about these gazes. He leaped down from the stone stage and was just about to return to his seat when he abruptly discovered the Heavenly Flame in his body leaping at this moment. His eyes followed the slight feeling. They finally paused on that somewhat quiet corner. There was a red-clothed lady wearing a veil. Both of her eyes were calmly observing him. There was a life-like flame symbol between her eyebrows that was quietly blooming.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Flame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A thought passed through Xiao Yan\u2019s mind as he looked at the fire symbol between the red-clothed lady\u2019s brows. The mysterious clans that Yao Lao had mentioned appeared within his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2026 is a member of the Yan clan, huh?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}
