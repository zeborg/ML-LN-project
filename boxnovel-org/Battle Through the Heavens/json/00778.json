Hence, he left the area where the Snake-People lived without obstruction while feeling at a loss. When he walked out of the isolation line and heard the human voices that once again rose in the outside world, the chaos in his mind finally began to gradually calm down.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan swung his head about. He recalled Medusa slight displeasure earlier and that she had not revealed herself even while he left. It seemed that his expressions earlier had caused her to feel some anger within her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, what a bastard\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan patted his head and sighed while scolding himself with a bitter smile. He was actually even more hesitant and had greater difficulty accepting this kind of matter compared to the female side. Moreover, this matter was his responsibility no matter how he put it. It was unexpected that it ended up with Medusa opening her mouth and saying words like she would raise the child alone once it was born.</p><br/><p>Although she and the Snake-People Race might hope that this was the case, this child would ultimately have the blood of the Xiao clan should this matter be true. Did he really dare to completely ignore it?</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was not a cold-blooded person. He did not hesitate much before he chose to make the highest grade Secret Technique that was most beneficial to the baby when the First Elder requested him to refine the other medicinal pill. No matter how one put it, the baby was his bloodline. How could he not give it the best things\u2026 however, this news had arrived too abruptly, destroying all of Xiao Yan\u2019s usual calm. Hence, the words he had said had accidentally appeared a little hurtful.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall apologize nicely the next time we meet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned his head and looked around this area while muttering in his heart. After which, he slowly left.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan met with Xiao Ding, Hai Bodong, and the others after he had returned to the division of the Yan Alliance that was situated at the Black Mountain Fortress. They engaged in a discussion before deciding that they would enact the assassination tomorrow. After all, there was little time left. Once the Gold Geese Sect\u2019s and the Mulan Valley\u2019s core strength delivered some rare medicinal pills, the two elite Dou Zongs might be able to recover some strength. It would be somewhat troublesome to assassinate them at that time.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan mused for a moment after deciding the time to attack. After which, he found a chamber and began to adjust his aura a little. He did not tell Xiao Ding about the matter with Medusa. He knew that given big brother\u2019s character, it was likely that the latter would get extremely excited if he knew that Medusa\u2019s womb might have the bloodline of the Xiao clan. However, the truth of this matter had yet to be ascertained. If it was indeed just a mistake when the time came, it would only cause people to be excited for no reason. Therefore, he planned to let Xiao Ding and the others know about it only when this matter was confirmed.</p><br/><p>The first thing that Xiao Yan did within the Secret Chamber was to take out the \u2018Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill\u2019 medicinal formula that the First Elder from the Snake-People Tribe gave him. After which, he began to carefully read it.</p><br/><p>The medicinal formula of this kind of \u2018Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill\u2019 was somewhat strange. Its main purpose was to help an unborn baby borrow the pure medicinal strength to open up and even expand some of the veins within their bodies while still in their mother\u2019s womb. In this way, the baby would be able to achieve double the effect with half the effort when it trained after being borned. Due to this being natural, the baby would have a much easier time practicing any kind of Qi Method. This kind of medicinal pill was undoubtedly priceless to some sects or clans with an extremely powerful strength. As long as they possessed this, they would be able to repeatedly groom training geniuses with outstanding talents.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had seen one or two kinds of medicinal formula that were similar to the \u2018Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill\u2019 among the medicinal formulas that Yao Lao had left behind. However, they lacked a dominating feeling when compared to the latter. Xiao Yan did not know just where did the Snake-People Tribe obtained such a medicinal formula from. Should this be released, it would definitely arouse the jealousy of quite a number of powerful factions. After all, as long as one had this thing, it could provide one with unending amounts of outstanding blood. This possessed an allure that was difficult for any type of factions.</p><br/><p>Although this medicinal formula was valuable, the medicinal strength of this \u2018Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill\u2019 was a little overbearing. An ordinary unborn baby would likely have difficulty enduring the infiltration of this medicinal strength. However, it was fortunate that the Medusa bloodline possessed a faint ancient bloodline. The baby would be able to withstand a little of this kind of overbearing medicinal strength because of that bloodline.</p><br/><p>\u201cTier 7\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned slightly as he gently played with the scroll in his hand. This kind of mysterious pill that possessed the ability to alter one\u2019s constitution was extremely difficult to refine. Its chances of failure were also extremely high. Moreover, the most frightening thing was that a medicinal pill of this tier had a chance of stirring up natural energy when it was formed within the cauldron before finally attracting a lightning disaster. This kind of lightning disaster was also called a pill calamity within the alchemist world. Its strength was extremely great and one could end up dead with a destroyed pill if one was not careful. Hence, even some alchemists who had the ability to refine a tier 7 medicinal pill would try to avoid refining this kind of medicinal pill that could attract a pill calamity. From this, one could also guess why the Snake-People Tribe had not obtained a \u2018Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill\u2019 after so many years.</p><br/><p>This formula was not only just a matter of gathering medicinal ingredients. One had to also find a high tier alchemist who had the ability and the courage to risk his life in order to be able to refine it.</p><br/><p>An alchemist who had the ability to refine this kind of medicinal pill could basically be considered someone at the grandmaster class even in the entire Dou Qi continent. Who would take the risk of being struck by lightning to help someone refine this kind of medicinal pill for nothing? Their lives were extremely valuable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe medicinal ingredients that it requires are also quite troublesome. However, it is fortunate that there is a two year time period. It will be possible to take things slowly\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sighed softly. He carefully stored this medicinal formula properly before musing for a moment. His hand moved and he took out a blood-red scroll from within his storage ring. Some dark coldness seeped out the moment this scroll appeared. It was surprisingly the medicinal formula for the \u2018Life Devouring Pill\u2019 that Xiao Li had luckily obtained from the deep mountains within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 back then.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze stared at this medicinal formula. His expression was somewhat cold and stern. Although the development pace of the current \u2018Yan Alliance\u2019 was fast, it was still a little weak when compared with factions like the Poison Sect and the Gold Geese Sect. This was not merely in terms of the peak experts. It was even more prominent in terms of the core strength.</p><br/><p>However, how could grooming a core strength of experts,who could hold their own, happen within a short period of time? At such times, the \u2018Life Devouring Pill\u2019 would be the fastest shortcut.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xiao Yan was also aware of the side-effect of the \u2018Life Devouring Pill\u2019. This matter was something he had also discussed with Xiao Ding, Hai Bodong, and the couple of Yan Alliance Elders. All of them decided unanimously that it would be best that they could truly create a group of fighters who were unafraid to die (death fighters) that were completely loyal to the Yan Alliance. Although they may only have a three year lifespan as a result of this, they were all confident that they would definitely be able to get the Yan Alliance to become one of the most powerful factions within the northwestern region as long as they could endure these three years. This might might be a little bloody but the implication of the Yan Alliance was too great. One example was this battle. Had Xiao Yan not hurried over at a crucial point in time, it was likely that the entire Jia Ma Empire would have been eliminated. At that time, an unknown number of people would have lost their lives.</p><br/><p>If one wanted to protect even more people, it was only natural that there must be the sacrifice of a small group of people.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter resolving this matter, I will hand this medicinal formula to big brother before secretly dispatching alchemists to refine them. The actual death squad can only be left to big brother and the others to decide. However, such people must be absolutely loyal. As long as we can possess a group of Dou Wang class death fighters, the Yan Alliance can be considered to truly possess an infallible status in the Jia Ma Empire. It is also not impossible to dominate the northwestern region in the future.\u201d Xiao Yan muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan solemnly returned this medicinal formula to his ring as this thought flashed across his heart. He let out a long sigh as hand seals began to slowly form. His eyes were gradually shut as he entered into the training condition.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had broken through to the Dou Huang class and left the small mountain valley, Xiao Yan had never truly calmed down to train. The big battle from a couple of years ago had also caused him to be always tensed up, not daring to relax even a little. Only now that Xiao Yan had finished this matter did he have the time to quietly nurse his body.</p><br/><p>The air within the chamber began to fluctuate slightly after Xiao Yan entered his training condition. Waves of natural energy surfaced. After which, they turned into two small colorful snakes that entered his nostrils. After which, they were swiftly refined by the two kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 within his body before transforming into threads of pure Dou Qi that flowed in his veins. In the end, Dou Qi was assimilated into every part of his body.</p><br/><p>This battle with two elite Dou Zongs in one day had greatly exhausted Xiao Yan. This was especially the case when he had unleashed a frightening move like the three colored \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019. Not only did it greatly exhaust his Dou Qi but his Spiritual Strength had also become much weaker as a result. However, it was fortunate that Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Strength was stronger than an ordinary person. His recovery speed was also quite gratifying. Hence, his exhausted Spiritual Strength had automatically recovered within a short couple of days.</p><br/><p>After having used the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 so many times, Xiao Yan faintly sensed that his Spiritual Strength had appeared to become increasingly more mellow. It filled with more strength during the recovery cycle after this kind of exhaustion. His Spiritual Perception had also become much sharper than before because of this.</p><br/><p>His training quietly continued amid this dullness. By the time Xiao Yan had withdrawn from this training mode, glaring sunlight shot into the chamber from a small window. The rays left behind numerous light spots on the ground.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly opened his eyes. A somewhat whitish and hot aura was spat out from Xiao Yan. His expression had also become radiant in an instant. A hot fire glow flickered within his dark-black eyes before gradually fading a moment later.</p><br/><p>\u201cBattle is really the shortcut to raise one\u2019s level\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stretched his lazy waist. He could sense that his strength had improved slightly after the battle with Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders. The current him had already completely stabilized at the one star Dou Huang level. It had only been a month since he had broken through to the Dou Huang class. Such speed was considered fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026 today, it is time to act\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan moved his hand and a gray-colored jade piece appeared in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. The corner of his mouth moved slightly as a somewhat dark, cold smile surfaced.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
