The last people to arrive were Hekkeran and the members of Foresight, for a total of 18 people. All of the people gathered for this job were capable Workers within the Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>Each team kept a fixed distance from the others, and at the same time they sized each other up warily, so the fact that every single eye went to the members of Foresight as they arrived last was quite an intimidating sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s a few familiar faces. Speaking of which, didn\u2019t we meet that stag beetle at the Katze Plains?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStrange, didn\u2019t I mention it at the inn? Gringam\u2019s team was hired too\u2026 what, I didn\u2019t tell you? I have the feeling that I brought it up\u2026 in any case, as you can see, all the notable Workers in the Empire are gathered under one roof! A warm round of applause for our client\u2019s ample finances!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can dispense with the applause, I think. Let\u2019s leave that aside for now; the ones over there should be the team leaders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone present was divided into their teams, and among them, a group of three people were discussing information.</p><br/><p>\u201cGringam\u2019s there too, right. Okay, I\u2019ll go over to say hi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah! Ugeh, that bastard\u2019s here too? Ah! Seriously? Then, those elf girls must be\u2026 this is terrible. Die, you son of a bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Imina muttered bitterly to herself. She might have been keeping her voice down, but Hekkeran and the others still panicked as they surveyed their surroundings for signs of hostility/</p><br/><p>\u201cImina-san!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, Rober. He\u2019s a colleague for the duration of this job, after all\u2026 but I just wish I didn\u2019t have to see his face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014I don\u2019t like him either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, if you want to talk about whether or not we like him, then I hate him too, but you need to mind your attitude.\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of \u201cyou\u2019re really annoying\u201d came over Imina\u2019s face. Hekkeran came between her and Roberdyck, then smiled mischievously as he shrugged.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hey, I\u2019m going over to greet him. Don\u2019t say annoying things like that. What if I end up showing it on my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWork hard, leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Roberdyck cheer him on, Hekkeran deliberately scrunched up his face and grumbled, \u201cthose two talk like it doesn\u2019t concern them\u201d, and then went over to the group of three people.</p><br/><p>The first to greet Hekkeran as he walked over was a Worker in a suit of steel-colored full plate armor. Due to the strange, rounded structure of the plates and the curiously oversized pauldrons, he did not look like a human being so much as a beetle standing on two legs.</p><br/><p>A large horn stuck straight out of his helmet, a sign that he was deliberately cultivating that image.</p><br/><p>However, the part after that was not intentional. The man\u2019s legs were very short, so he looked like a stag beetle that a child had deliberately forced to stand on its hind legs. A nicer way of putting it would be to say that his short, stumpy legs stood securely upon the ground, and he had a Dwarven physique that was well-suited to being a warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I expected, thou cam\u2019st too, Hekkeran.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Gringam. I thought the terms this time round weren\u2019t too bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran waved to the other two people. His attitude was hardly dignified, but neither of them looked unhappy. This was because the four of them might have been of different ages and had different experiences, but they were equally skilled as Workers.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, your guys\u2026\u201d Hekkeran glanced at Gringam\u2019s team and counted them before replying: \u201cThere\u2019s only five of you; what happened to the other members?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are taking their rest, and alleviating their fatigue. In addition, they worked the same assignment as myself, and now they must repair or replace their damaged or destroyed panoply.\u201d</p><br/><p>This man \u2014 Gringam \u2014 led the team called Heavy Masher, a large Worker team with 14 members.</p><br/><p>There were merits in having numbers on one\u2019s side. One of them was the ability to approach a job from many different angles, which gave one many ways to handle a job. In particular, the ability to recombine into a team that could take on any request was a great boon.</p><br/><p>However, that approach also contained demerits. One of them was the fact that payment was divided among the number of people, and so each individual would be paid less. The second flaw was that deciding something would take a very long time, which led to slow movements.</p><br/><p>After adding up the pros and cons, the fact that this man could group up Workers and their tendency to break apart based on personality conflicts, and then go one step further to perfectly control them was a sign of his great skill as a manager.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~ That\u2019s tough. Although\u2026 why don\u2019t you act as our support, so the friends you left behind won\u2019t end up hating you for earning too much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUtter foolery. As a leader in mine own right, the task falls to me to assuage the underlings once the task is concluded. Regretfully, our band must seek the best possible outcome for ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, oi, don\u2019t be like that. I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019ll be fine if you speak normally around us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gringam smiled thinly. Hekkeran saw that he did not agree, and so he shrugged and turned to the other man.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve spoken face to face with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He extended a hand to the other man as a show of respect, and that man took it. His was a sturdy and strong hand.</p><br/><p>His narrowed eyes flickered, then focused on Hekkeran.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Foresight. I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was as clear as a bell. One could say it fit his appearance very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou too, Tenbu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300c\uff0c\u300e\u300f\u3002\u300d</p><br/><p>There was nobody who did not know of this genius swordsman, who was undefeated in the arena. This man\u2019s team \u2014 Tenbu \u2014 was essentially a team composed of one man, to some extent. However, that was also why Imina\u2019s face contorted with disgust.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m glad to be able to team up with a sword genius who can rival the mightiest warrior of the Kingdom \u2014 the great Gazef Stronoff.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. However, shouldn\u2019t you say that he can rival me \u2014 Eruya Uzruth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh~ bold words~\u201d</p><br/><p>Eruya smiled coldly, an arrogant look on his face. After seeing his expression, Hekkeran blinked several times to hide the emotion he had nearly revealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, I look forward to seeing your swordsmanship on full display in the ruins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. You can leave that to me. I hope there\u2019ll be a monster in those ruins who can give me a challenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eruya patted the weapon at his side.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026We don\u2019t know what kind of monster may emerge. For all we know, we might even encounter a Dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that would be a frightening sight. Perhaps a powerful monster like a Dragon might challenge me. However, I\u2019ll win in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now,\u201d Hekkeran smiled, albeit on the surface. He glanced to see the reaction of the last person, and worked to suppress his own feelings.</p><br/><p>He recalled a rumour going around that in swordsmanship alone, Eruya was more than a match even for an orichalcum-ranked adventurer, so perhaps that answer of his was no idle boast. In addition, confidence in his own abilities was a good thing; bragging was very important for Workers.</p><br/><p>Of course, that was as long as he did not take it too far.</p><br/><p>Dragons were the mightiest species on the world.</p><br/><p>They soared through the sky and expelled ruinous breath from their maws. Their scales were sturdy and their physical attributes were extraordinary. Old Dragons could even use magic. They possessed a lifespan incomparable to those of human beings, and even a sage would have to admit defeat to their accumulated wisdom.</p><br/><p>Due to their power, stories frequently depicted them as wicked foes, or beings who lent a hand to heroes. The objective of the Thirteen Heroes\u2019 last adventure was the Dragon known as the Divine Dragon. In much the same way, the final adversary of a hero was often one of the Draconic race.</p><br/><p>It was quite startling how he could compare himself to such a powerful being and act so cockily, even if it was idle banter. His swaggering tone sounded like he was joking, but unfortunately Eruya\u2019s eyes were serious. How full of himself was he?</p><br/><p>Nobody knew what sort of monsters lay within the ruins they would soon be visiting. He predicted that Eruya\u2019s mental state was very dangerous and might end up dragging down everybody else as well. That ought to be the case.</p><br/><p>I\u2019d better stay away from him.</p><br/><p>It was his own business if he wanted to die, but it would be troublesome if he came over to beg for help. Hekkeran smiled to him, and having made that decision, he amended his approach to Eruya; now he would be \u201cused and then discarded\u201d.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the people over there should be the members of Foresight. Oya\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of disdain and scorn filled Eruya\u2019s eyes the moment he saw Imina.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Eruya had been born in the religious nation that revered humanity as the greatest of all races; the Slaine Theocracy. The citizens of that country often viewed people with nonhuman ancestry as second-class citizens.</p><br/><p>From that man\u2019s point of view, having a Half-Elf like Imina working on an even basis with him must be very upsetting.</p><br/><p>That part of him lends truth to the rumors\u2026 however, if he really was born in the Theocracy, then he ought to have a baptismal name. There\u2019s also a rumor that he abandoned his baptismal name.</p><br/><p>Hekkeran grumbled in his heart, and just to be sure, he muttered:</p><br/><p>\u201cOi oi, hands off my buddies, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. For the duration of this job, we are all comrades. I will work together with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI would very much like to believe those words.\u201d</p><br/><p>This man Eruya was like a strong kid who had directly become an adult. He unnerved others; or rather, he was mentally unbalanced to some extent. The mood around him was distasteful to others, and even after reminding him, Hekkeran could not find it in himself to relax.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes, please believe me. Now then, let\u2019s return to the previous topic. In any event, I\u2019d like to turn overall command of the expeditions to someone else. Provided it\u2019s not too troubling, I will obey the instructions of all the other members. Feel free to use me as a vanguard during battle; I will cut down all the foes before us with this blade.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, understood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026In that case, I\u2019ll be returning to my team. Let me know if there\u2019s anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eruya bowed, and then left.</p><br/><p>As he saw the women waiting for Eruya, Hekkeran\u2019s face twisted for a moment. However, he could not let his feelings be written on his face. Allowing others to know how he felt might occasionally prove disadvantageous, and someone like that was not fit to lead a team.</p><br/><p>He quelled his emotions, and hid his expression.</p><br/><p>He turned away, like he had seen something filthy, and greeted the last person.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, honored elder. You\u2019re as healthy as ever.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHoi, Hekkeran. You seem well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wheezed whenever he spoke, because almost all his front teeth had fallen out.</p><br/><p>He was Palpatra \u201cGreen Leaf\u201d Ogrion.</p><br/><p>The source of his nickname was the suit of armor he wore, which resembled green leaves glistening with morning dew. That armor was not made of metal, but the scales of a Green Dragon. Palpatra and his team had once succeeded in a Dragon Hunt. Of course, it was not a very big Dragon, but even a small Dragon was not a foe which an average Worker or adventurer could handle.</p><br/><p>Palpatra was an old man who was in his 80th year of life.</p><br/><p>Usually, people in this line of work retired after the age of 45. There were also some who would retire in their early forties. Very few people remained as adventurers after the age of 50. The people who worked such a cruel job where death was a very real danger could not ignore the effects of age withering their bodies.</p><br/><p>In truth, Palpatra was an exception, but his strength had deteriorated greatly from when he was in his prime \u2014 apparently, when he had reached the level of the orichalcum-ranked. Even so, Palpatra refused to step down from the frontlines.</p><br/><p>Palpatra and the way he continued adventuring despite his advanced age was an object of admiration for many people in the field.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm, still, he seems a little dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even more wrinkles appeared on Palpatra\u2019s already-wrinkled face, and he lowered his voice, a gesture of which Hekkeran approved.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. If he wants to die, that\u2019s his problem, but I\u2019d rather not go down with him as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGranted, he is very strong, but excessive confidence might end up endangering his compatriots. He is extremely dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gringam seemed to be muttering something along the lines of \u201chow troublesome\u201d. After seeing Eruya\u2019s attitude probably all the workers were thinking the same thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, how strong is he? I haven\u2019t been to the arena in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKnow\u2019st thou not? I am aware\u2026 is it not the same for thee, revered elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve only heard of his prowess, but I haven\u2019t actually seen it with my own eyes. Perhaps I could ask my companions. However, when we get down to it, what are we going to use as a benchmark for strength? For instance, if we used Gazef Stronoff as an upper limit, then where would something we were more familiar with\u2026 like say\u2026 the Empire\u2019s Four Knights stand on that scale?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Knights who are also known as Heavy Explosion, The Immovable, Lightning Bolt and Violent Gale, huh\u2026 using them as a benchmark only complicates things. The four of them ought to be inferior to that great man \u2014 to the Kingdom\u2019s Warrior-Captain \u2014 but then, the days of Gazef Stronoff towering over the common herd are a thing of the past. As time goes by, new powerful warriors will emerge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want to say Uzruth is one of them, that he\u2019s really that strong? Besides, I\u2019ve never seen the power of the Four Knights up close\u2026 the strongest person I\u2019ve seen is probably the leader of the Platinum Imperial Guard, who answer directly to the Emperor himself. That man\u2019s skill is quite something\u2026 as I recall, he\u2019s on par with the Four Knights?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mightiest entities I know of are the Dragon Lords of the Council Alliance. Humanity cannot defeat foes like those.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSome say there\u2019s five of them, others say there\u2019s seven\u2026 Ah, we\u2019re looking for a way to gauge Uzruth\u2019s strength. Please limit yourself to human swordsmen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat said the Agrand Council Alliance\u2019s swordsmen are almost all demihumans, so we\u2019ll have to count them out as well. The Martial Lord of the arena is the same way. Then I\u2019ll cite the lady paladin of the Roble Holy Kingdom, who wields a holy sword. That said, she does seem somewhat inadequate in terms of pure swordsmanship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Collecting information on mighty individuals was very important for a Worker, when it came to handling jobs. That was because the presence or absence of such information often determined victory or defeat. And of course, that aside, they were all warriors, and they could not help but want to know more about people who inhabited the world of martial arts with them.</p><br/><p>It was the same now. The conversation had started by discussing Eruya\u2019s strength, but things had gotten more and more heated, and it became something like a swap meet for news about powerful beings. It was like a group of kids arguing about who was strongest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Slaine Theocracy\u2019s people tend to be of a uniformly high level, but I haven\u2019t heard of any particularly outstanding individuals among them. Then again, even if they were, divine magic casters are outside the scope of this discussion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard there\u2019s a female warrior in the Kingdom\u2019s highest-ranked adventurer team. What of her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, the \u201cno breasts, just pecs\u201d one, am I right? She\u2019s very strong. Although, I heard that she lost a duel with the Warrior Captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I heard an adventurer addressed her with that made-up nickname and got beaten half to death. Hahaha, what a frightening young lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter mentioning the names of the strong, I\u2019ve come to realize that there aren\u2019t many powerful pure swordsmen. There\u2019s Dark Knight of the Heroes of the City-State Alliance. Then there\u2019s \u201cFlash\u201d Cerebrate of the Draconic Kingdom\u2019s adamantite-ranked adventurer team Crystal Tear, as well as \u201cCrimson\u201d Optix of the Worker team \u201cBlazing Inferno\u201d, and then the Kingdom\u2019s\u2026 Brain Unglaus.\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation stopped here for the first time.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrain Unglaus? Who\u2019s he?\u201d</p><br/><p>Palpatra directed that puzzled question at Gringam.</p><br/><p>\u201cDost thou not know, revered elder? That man is a famed swordsman of the Kingdom\u2026 what about thee?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran shook his head in response to that question. He had never heard that name before.</p><br/><p>\u201cVerily, all of thee know not\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gringam could not hide the look of disappointment on his face. Then, he spoke in a voice that lacked confidence, like he was perusing memories of the past:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a matter of years gone by, when I once took part in the Kingdom\u2019s grand martial tournament. During the semi-finals, I had the privilege of measuring his blade skills a measure. At that time, mine abilities could not hope to compare to his.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the tournament which Gazef Stronoff won, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. In the end, Unglaus met defeat at Stronoff\u2019s hands, but the battle of those contenders was truly a sight to behold. They were paragons of swordsmanship both; how did he deflect that flash of light? And being able to strike with but a single curve of the blade under those circumstances\u2026.mine eyes were opened upon witnessing such sights and more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Given the way Gringam was gushing with praise for him, and the fact that he could fight evenly with Gazef Stronoff, the mightiest warrior of the surrounding nations, it was clear that his strength must have been top-rate.</p><br/><p>So it was just that he did not know that the world contained such skilled exponents. Hekkeran was filled with awe.</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm\u2026 then, who do you think is stronger, between that Unglaus chap and Uzruth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUzruth,\u201d Gringam answered without any delay. \u201cIf he had to battle Unglaus from the grand martial tournament, it would definitely be him. I witnessed a fight of his in the arena recently, and I am certain of it,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that means he can stand on par with the Warrior-Captain from several years ago? Is he really that strong? Oh my.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran had exclaimed in a moment of excitement, and he hurriedly lowered his volume.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, Unglaus, is it. Looks like I\u2019ll have to pay attention to news from the Kingdom\u2026 alright, have you two heard of it? That there\u2019s a third adamantite-ranked adventurer team in the Kingdom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, pardon me, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHekkeran\u2026 ignorance will endanger thy team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that, but I just don\u2019t have the money to gather information about our friends in the Kingdom. I can\u2019t spare the cash.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyahyahya, how bold! I do not dislike such courage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRevered elder, I seek your opinion on a certain matter. Having heard the rumors of Darkness\u2019 Momon, do you not feel they are far too exaggerated? They say the two of them slew a Gigant Basilisk, without the aid of a healer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUwah, it ought to be just a rumor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Such a mighty foe (a Gigant Basilisk) could not be felled by just two people, not even if they were adamantite-ranked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThou agree\u2019st with me then, Hekkeran? The more news I gather, the more dubious the provenance of such. It has even reached mine ears that during the great uproar in the Kingdom, he dispatched a fiend of well over 200 difficulty in but a single blow, To me, that might be a fabrication concocted by the Adventurer\u2019s Guild of the Kingdom to frighten those within and without the nation, and thus they granted those people the rank of adamantite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s possible. After all, the birth of a high-ranking adventurer is a momentous occasion. Still, would the Guild tell such lies? The Guild is quite stubborn about the way they do things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Guildmaster of each city handles things differently. The Guildmaster from my adventuring days was filth. So I punched him right in the face! Hyahyahya! I\u2019m a Worker now, thanks to that!\u201d</p><br/><p>Palpatra laughed loudly and with good cheer.</p><br/><p>His reasons for becoming an adventurer were well known. Anyone in the business within the Imperial Capital would have heard of it. Palpatra would repeatedly recount the incident whenever he sat down to drink.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat said, I feel the Guild wouldn\u2019t do something like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you think it\u2019s true, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe. Even if you viewed it in the most generous terms, a difficulty of 200\u2026 that number alone is suspicious; any foe who was that powerful could not possibly be felled in a single blow. I think that part was an exaggeration that was deliberately spread. If an extremely high-difficulty demon really did show up, they probably engaged it with multiple teams and then had Darkness deal it the finishing blow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sounds more likely.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, if you counted all the adventurers who were stronger than orichalcum-rank as being adamantite-rank, I could believe such a mighty warrior existed. After all, adamantite rank can cover a very broad range.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHekkeran and I are of one mind, but thou feel\u2019st it is true, do you not, revered elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyahyahya. I don\u2019t consider it to be entirely true either.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing is believing, as they say. I wish we could meet the man himself\u2026 then again, maybe not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the other two were expressing their agreement with Hekkeran, they heard the sound of flesh striking flesh, followed by a woman trying to bite back a scream of pain.</p><br/><p>All the Workers present turned their eyes onto the same spot. Several of them had already lowered themselves into battle-ready stances, believing something had happened.</p><br/><p>The source of the scream lay before Eruya \u2014 one of his female companions, who lay upon the ground. Judging by the circumstances, Eruya had probably punched her. The woman looked up at Eruya\u2019s face, which was twisted in anger. Her own face was filled with fear as she begged pathetically for forgiveness.</p><br/><p>Hekkeran fought back a rising wave of nausea, and a thought flashed through his mind. He hurriedly turned his attention towards his companion \u2014 Imina.</p><br/><p>Just as he had imagined, her face had gone blank. There was a dangerous air around her, as though she would launch an attack if things went any further.</p><br/><p>Hekkeran hurriedly signalled to Roberdyck and Arche who were standing beside her, telling them to hold her back.</p><br/><p>Personally speaking, Hekkeran was as angry as Imina was. However, he could not stick his nose into the problems of other teams. Of course, he could do so if he wanted. However, if he did, he would need to be prepared to bear all the consequences of that choice. That was the reason why the other teams simply wrinkled their brows in displeasure, but none of them made a move.</p><br/><p>Imina\u2019s reason eventually overcame her desire to fight, and she spat on the ground after directing a lewd gesture at his back.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The only thing he has that\u2019s comparable to the Kingdom\u2019s Warrior-Captain is his swordsmanship. It would be wonderful if his character were similar to his as well, but I guess that\u2019s too much to ask for. Alright, we\u2019ll stop here for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Indeed. Since Hekkeran\u2019s here too, let\u2019s decide the most important thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man refused, so who\u2019ll be our overall leader?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them fell silent.</p><br/><p>There were four teams present here. While all of them possessed ample fighting power, without someone to coordinate and lead everyone, they would not be able to take effective action. It was like having many arms but being unable to use them all at the same time; little different from only having one.</p><br/><p>Being able to make effective use of a team of strong personalities was not an easy task, and doing so without complaints from anybody was even more difficult. If the instructions resulted in failure, or if others thought that one was placing their own team\u2019s gain above their own, it would incur the wrath of the other teams.</p><br/><p>Frankly speaking, the position demanded excellent skills, yet there were more demerits than merits to taking it.</p><br/><p>Every team leader understood that point, so they all remained silent while watching each other\u2019s faces. Each of them wanted to dump this burden onto the first person to open their mouth. After about a minute\u2019s silence, Hekkeran tiredly suggested:</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly, we don\u2019t need an overall leader, do we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just delaying the inevitable. It\u2019ll be troublesome once fighting breaks out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Mine idea is that we should alternate. That way resentment will not accrue. I feel we may discuss the matter at greater length upon reaching the ruins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do have a point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them approved of Gringam\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll go in order of when we arrive there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about Uzruth and his Tenbu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine if we skip that punk. Besides, he won\u2019t be able to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree, revered elder. Then, as the one who proposed it, my Heavy Masher shall take the lead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m counting on you, Gringam.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do, young man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. That said, there will hardly be any vicious monsters within the Empire. The problem lies within the Kingdom; a situation may arise once we draw near the great forest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh~ If I\u2019d known I\u2019d have reversed the order.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran made a show of grabbing his head in mock regret, while the other two smiled quietly. After that, they immediately quelled their facial expressions and turned to look at a man who was walking towards the Workers. The surrounding Workers had already turned to face him.</p><br/><p>The Count\u2019s butler walked proudly through the courtyard that was dimly lit by the brightening sky, with a pose that befitted a servant of a Count.</p><br/><p>He arrived before the Workers, and bowed. Nobody responded to it, but he did not mind; instead opening his mouth and saying:</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is time. My thanks to everyone for accepting my Lord\u2019s request. We shall dispatch two drivers with you and six adventurers as an escort. The objective is an unexplored ruin within the Kingdom \u2014 very likely to be a tomb, from the structure of it. The duration of the expedition will be three days, and the bonus will be awarded based on what my master learns, so we will arrange later on. Are there any questions?\u201d</p><br/><p>The butler had said the same thing as the employment request; the only difference was probably the presence of adventurers as bodyguards.</p><br/><p>They wanted to know how the Count had learned about the ruins, but the Workers knew which questions could be answered and which questions could not. If their employer was willing to tell them, then he would have said so when hiring them.</p><br/><p>Besides, if this job was really so clear-cut and aboveboard, adventurers could take care of it. Since it was dirty work, the employer had to keep quiet, and so not asking would be safer.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026In that case, I shall take you all to your awaiting carriages.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody objected, and so everyone followed behind him.</p><br/><p>Hekkeran and the rest of Foresight were at the end of the group.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fucking son of a bitch, why isn\u2019t he dead yet? How about it, want to kill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Imina could not tolerate Eruya, and she whispered her displeasure into Hekkeran\u2019s ear the moment she was beside him, in order to vent her anger.</p><br/><p>Her voice was very soft; there was no telling if it was because she was utterly furious or because she was trying to restrain herself. Hekkeran did not know, and could only hope it was the latter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard it before, but he really is a crude man.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014He\u2019s absolutely disgusting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two replied quietly, making no attempt to hide their displeasure.</p><br/><p>It was only natural that Foresight would think that way. With a woman like Imina as their companion, there was no way they could tolerate Eruya\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>Aside from Eruya himself, the rest of his team was all female, and they were all Elves.</p><br/><p>Imina and the other team members would not have been revolted by him if that was all. However, there was a reason why they had the unanimous and unreserved opinion that Eruya was a piece of disgusting filth.</p><br/><p>The Elf girls were minimally equipped with crudely-made gear. In addition, their short-cut hair exposed their long elven ears, which had been cut in half at the middle.</p><br/><p>The reason why Eruya\u2019s team members were like this was because they were all Elven slaves from the Slaine Theocracy.</p><br/><p>The previous system of slavery in the Empire had undergone a great reform under the previous Emperor. They were still slaves in name, but their situation was completely different. However, just like the demihumans in the arena, the conditions of some slaves had not been improved.</p><br/><p>The Elf slaves Eruya had in tow belonged to that type.</p><br/><p>The three nations of the Baharuth Empire, the Re-Estize Kingdom and the Slaine Theocracy were almost all human, and they discriminated more heavily against other races than the other surrounding nations. Thus, even humanoid species \u2014 like Half-Elves and Elves \u2014 had a hard time living in these countries.</p><br/><p>Only the Dwarves were an exception. The Azellisian Mountain Range that stood between the Kingdom and the Empire contained a Dwarven Kingdom, and due to the trading relationship the Empire had with the Dwarves, they were assured of protection under the law.</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel sorry for the Elves. However, we should not try to save them now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Imina sighed heavily. She understood that fact in her head; her heart was simply taking longer to catch up.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Imina moved to the head of the group after that quiet reply, and the others quickened their pace so as not to fall behind. Then, their eyes all went wide in surprise.</p><br/><p>There were two large covered carriages waiting at the place where the butler had taken them, which would be heading for the ruins. There was also a group of people helping to load their luggage onto the carriages. Those ought to be the adventurers that the butler mentioned, because the metal plates around their necks glinted with a golden light.</p><br/><p>However, what surprised them was not the adventurers, but the horses pulling the carriages.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Sleipnirs, \u201c someone exclaimed in surprise.</p><br/><p>The eight-legged Sleipnirs were larger than an average horse and possessed excellent physical strength, stamina and mobility. Some people considered them to be the ideal creature for land travel.</p><br/><p>Naturally, they commanded a startling price as well. Most nobles could not afford a mount that cost five times as much as a warhorse.</p><br/><p>Yet, there were two two-horse carriages before them, for a total of 4 Sleipnirs. Their employer must have considered the risk of losing them during adventuring, and so his determination was very admirable. Or could it be he felt that they would unearth so much treasure that only Sleipnirs would be able to move them?</p><br/><p>Everyone was probably thinking the same thing. The sound of swallowing came from somewhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease use these carriages. Your rations and other supplies are inside the vehicle compartment. In addition, we have hired adventurers to protect the carriage and your campsite. According to their contract, they cannot enter the ruins, so please keep that in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran realised that there was something which needed to be resolved right away, and so he left his companions and ran to Gringam.</p><br/><p>\u201cPardon me, Gringam, I need to discuss something with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat troubles thee that thou seek\u2019st my counsel?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen it comes to allocating carriages, could you put us separately from Tenbu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? Ah, I see. Thy concerns are known to me; thou fear\u2019st for that young lady, hm? In that case, we shall travel with Tenbu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, and thanks. You\u2019re a big help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPay it no heed; in this endeavour, we are comrades. A quarrel even before reaching the ruins would be a thorny matter, and I too am\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Are you sure we\u2019ll be fine with these puny gold-ranked adventurers? I don\u2019t want to come back to a wrecked camp or wake up to find myself sharing it with monsters!\u201d</p><br/><p>A great shout came with all the force of a fireball. Two people stared at each other, and tensions were running high.</p><br/><p>Eruya expressed his dissatisfaction to the butler, but he did not make any attempt to lower hsi volume. The adventurers stopped moving their luggage, as though time had stopped.</p><br/><p>When one looked up, one could see higher realms ahead. Whether or not one could reach those heights remained to be seen. Yet, some people continued marching toward their goal, one step at a time, and Eruya\u2019s statement was very displeasing to those people. They were engaged in a struggle to prove their strength, and once their competency was called into question \u2014 especially if their client doubted their ability \u2014 it would affect future tasks that they were assigned. In that case, they had to prove their worth in a simple and quick fashion.</p><br/><p>This man, whose words could not be tolerated by either the adventurers or the Workers, did not know how to consider things from the perspective of others. Therefore, he was virtually unaffected by the foul mood in the air, and continued babbling to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I do understand that they\u2019re fit to handle our luggage, I\u2019m simply concerned that they won\u2019t be able to help us get rid of threats.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u300c\uff0c\uff0c\u3002\u300d</p><br/><p>Give me a break! What good does it do to ruin the mood? Granted, they\u2019re here for work, so they should be able to bear with it a little, but still\u2026</p><br/><p>Level-wise, all the Worker teams here were on par with mithril-ranked adventurers, which meant that they were better than these adventurers. However, some things ought not to be said out loud.</p><br/><p>Someone, anyone, punch him to shut him up.</p><br/><p>Several of the Workers had evil glints in their eyes, and they were exchanging glances. Hekkeran hurriedly ran over to Imina. No matter what happened, he could not let her draw her blade.</p><br/><p>However, the person who came to stop this was not a Worker.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must be Uzruth-sama, hm? I assure you that there will be no problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Are you saying that on the assumption that we\u2019re helping too? I could understand it, in that case.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. That is because there will be a stronger individual travelling with you \u2014 Momon-san.\u201d</p><br/><p>A warrior in full plate armor poked his helmeted head out from one of the carriages, as though in response to the butler\u2019s icy tones. He had probably been in the middle of moving luggage onto the carriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow me to introduce you to the adamantite-ranked adventurer team of two, Momon-san of Darkness and his teammate Nabe. The two of them will travel with you and defend your campsite. I trust you will be able to accept that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The air changed again. The pinnacle of adventurers and Workers \u2014 those who handled this sort of work \u2014 now stood before them. None of the Workers could speak in the face of this proof of absolute strength.</p><br/><p>The adventurers regained their good spirits as they saw the Workers\u2019 naked reaction to the most highly-placed of all adventurers, and they went back to their work. A man who looked like the adventurer team\u2019s leader smiled, and then spoke to the dark warrior:</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll handle the rest; Momon-san, would you mind interacting with the Workers? Being that you\u2019re our leader, I hope that you will discuss our security posture with the workers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. As long as your team agrees, I\u2019ll take on this task, despite my lack of ability. However, I believe you should be the ones to take charge of security. After all, you\u2019re more numerous, so it would be more convenient to follow your lead instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, no! What do you mean by a lack of ability? You\u2019re being too humble! Besides, how could we disregard the great Momon-san\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014No, I insist that you be in charge of security. Then, I\u2019ll be counting on you to skilfully command us. Nabe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Momon chuckled softly, and then lightly descended from the cabin. An astoundingly beautiful woman followed behind him.</p><br/><p>When a beautiful woman showed herself, people would sometimes make a commotion out of shock. However, once her looks exceeded a certain threshold, said people would not even be able to do that much. In the face of true beauty, all people could do was allow their gazes to be stolen away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHekkeran, he\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm, Rober, I\u2019m thinking the same thing too. We saw him before, at the North Market. That man is\u2026 Momon of Darkness, and his sole companion. When you look at his mighty form, perhaps the rumors of him beating the Gigant Basilisk were not so exaggerated after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGiga\u2026! Is what you say really true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I heard. In addition, I heard Gringam say that he took out a difficulty 200 demon in one blow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014That can\u2019t possibly be real, a difficulty of 200 isn\u2019t in the realm of possibility for a human being\u2026 could it be that you misheard 100 as 200?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven 100 would be quite amazing. But how shall I put this\u2026 after seeing his words and actions, I feel like it\u2019s the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had grasped Momon\u2019s character from his brief interaction with the leader of the gold-ranked adventurers. He felt that the man exuded the dignity and charisma befitting an adamantite-ranked adventurer, which naturally endeared others to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore we mingle\u2026 I have a question to ask you.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was soft, yet its rich tones allowed everyone to feel his heroic spirit through his armor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you going to the ruins? I know you\u2019ve been hired. But you\u2019re not like adventurers, who find it difficult to refuse a strongly worded request. Why would you, whose actions are not bound, choose to accept this assignment? What drives you to do such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Workers looked at each other. They hesitated over who should answer, and in the end, it was someone from Palpatra\u2019s team who spoke up.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor money, of course.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a perfect answer; there was no better reason than that. The Workers had not hesitated over what answer they should have given, and Momon should have expected such a matter-of-fact reply from them. The fact that he had still asked the question anyway left them at a loss as to his true intentions.</p><br/><p>After seeing the Workers murmur their agreement, Momon continued asking:</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is to say, if your client pays you a great deal of money, it\u2019s worth paying with your lives?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Our client offered us recompense that satisfied us. In addition, there might be a further prize depending on what we find within the ruins. It is my contention that such largesse warrants the risk of our lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>That answer came from Gringam.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 so this is what you have all decided, then? I understand. Please forgive me for asking such a worthless question.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a trifling matter requires no apology\u2026 do not allow it to weigh upon thy heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyahyahya, well, if you\u2019ve finished asking, might I ask a question in turn?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease do, old sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish to verify a rumor I\u2019ve heard. They say your strength is extraordinary; may I see if those rumors are factual?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, seeing is believing, after all. Of course you may. I shall show you my might if it means you will accept my\u2026 no, our protection. Then, how shall I demonstrate my power?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe best way is to spar with someone else, of course!\u201d</p><br/><p>All eyes gathered on\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2013And of course, I will be the one to do the sparring, that\u2019s right, me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You, old sir? \u2026My apologies, but I am not accustomed to holding back. I do not wish to harm you, yet I have no confidence in restraining myself\u2026 do you mind?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHyahyahyahya! That\u2019s adamantite for you! Not a thought given to the fact that I might hurt you instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>A quiet chuckle came from under the helmet.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course, old sir. This is the difference in our respective strengths \u2014 I am strong, stronger than any of you. That is why I can bear the name of adamantite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite his extraordinary arrogance and sense of superiority, it did not displease those who saw it. This must be the presence of the man called Momon. His statement overflowed with persuasive power in addition to a frightening puissance that could slay countless foes.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026How incredible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s just too amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>The feverish murmurs rose and fell.</p><br/><p>Many women adored strong men. In terms of respect, many men were fascinated by strong men. They were like moths mesmerized by a flame, and for those who lived in a world of blood and steel, great power was the flame in question. They could not tear themselves away from the charm that bound them, even though they knew that they would be immolated if they misjudged their distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyahyahya! I doubt anyone will doubt that you\u2019re adamantite-ranked now. Still, speaking of which, it\u2019s rare that we get a chance like this, so I\u2019d like to get a few pointers from you. The carriages here will get in the way, so could I borrow that patch of empty ground, butler-dono?\u201d</p><br/><p>After receiving permission, Palpatra led everyone to the courtyard. It was not just the Workers who followed him, but even the adventurers and butler as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cGiven the revered elder\u2019s skills, there\u2019s probably no way he can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014That man seems very strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm~ rather than say he is strong, it would be better so say that the divide between them is precipitous. Even the two adamantite-ranked adventurer teams in the Empire would hardly qualify as superhuman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a point there. Silver Canary\u2019s members have very exotic professions, so they each have strange skills, but their overall abilities fall below people with basic jobs. And I hear that the members of Eight Ripples derive their strength from their numbers and teamwork.\u201d</p><br/><p>Silver Canary was led by a heroic bard, and its members all had exotic vocations. Eight Ripples was a nine-man team. Due to their numbers, some said that their strength was not yet adamantite-level, but others also said that as long as they worked together to focus on a problem, they could handle problems which even other adamantite-ranked adventurers could not tackle.</p><br/><p>However, whether or not those two teams qualified as the secret weapons of the human race, those who could make the impossible possible, the strongest entities (adamantite) remained in doubt.</p><br/><p>Hekkeran said all that after hearing his teammates whisper from behind him.</p><br/><p>The three of them were not the only ones doing so. If one listened carefully, one could hear the rest of them discussing various topics. The most-repeated question was how long Palpatra could hold out. Nobody here felt that he could beat Momon, because even after their brief time together, everyone had acknowledged that the aura around Momon was most fitting of an adamantite-ranked adventurer.</p><br/><p>Hekkeran thought as he walked, and just then, someone came to his side. After hearing the noise of metal armor, there was no need to ask who it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cGringam, how do you think their fight will turn out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile saying so might upset the revered elder, there is no doubt that Momon will win. Beyond that is the question of how long the revered elder will endure. Wilt thou not queue behind the revered elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if, give me a break. How about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPermit me to humbly refuse. Witnessing a superhuman warrior in action is more than enough for myself. Although, I would not object to a few lessons on swordsmanship from him during the course of our journey.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSame here\u2026 ah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Momon and Palpatra stood before the two of them in the courtyard, maintaining a distance between and looking at each other.</p><br/><p>Palpatra\u2019s eyes were not those of an ordinary old man. They were those of a veteran campaigner.</p><br/><p>The aura around him had hardened into needle-like killing intent, and the air held no trace of this being just a regular old spar.</p><br/><p>Everyone present broke out in a cold sweat, their hearts filled with uneasiness.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hey, this is pretty bad, right? The old man\u2019s serious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Beside him, Gringam had reverted to his original way of speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, his opponent\u2019s an adamantite-ranked adventurer, so he\u2019s got no choice but to be serious. Still\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran shifted his eyes towards the dark warrior standing off against the old man. Having just spoken those words, he immediately drew a breath.</p><br/><p>He could not sense anything from Momon.</p><br/><p>His arms drooped down, he looked completely unguarded, and he did not look like he was about to fight a duel of blades. He was as composed as an adult looking at a child holding a sword.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing, he\u2019s not reacting even in the face of such powerful bloodlust. There\u2019s no way he couldn\u2019t have sensed his opponent\u2019s killing intent. So this is what the supreme perfection of warriorhood looks like. In other words, the supreme perfection of emptiness!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this what they call no-heart? Or the realm of clouds and water? He\u2019s so calm despite the difference in their weapons. He must be extremely confident in his skills\u2026 Ah, I want to throw myself down before him in awe.\u201d</p><br/><p>(TL Note: both of these are terms from Buddhist philosophy: no-heart refers to a lack of obstructive thoughts while clouds and water refers to moving and flowing freely)</p><br/><p>Palpatra was holding a magic item whose point was made from a whittled-down dragon\u2019s fang. In contrast, Momon held a staff he had borrowed from one of the adventurers. It did not look magical in any way. Magic weapons had all sorts of special effects, from improved sharpness, improving their wielders\u2019 abilities to doing additional damage and so on. Right now, Palpatra had an overwhelming advantage in terms of armament.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, that\u2019s probably not it. It\u2019s true when it comes to weapons, but the enchantments on Momon-san\u2019s armor ought to be stronger than the old man\u2019s. His other magic items ought to be of a higher standard too. Overall, I\u2019d say they\u2019re either pretty close or Momon-san has the advantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArt thou not too hasty in thine judgement? Hast thou not heard that the magic items the revered elder carries are worth more than an adamantite-ranked adventurer\u2019s panoply? The revered elder has completed countless jobs over the years. One could say he was the best paid man in the Empire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonono, wait, wait\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThou should\u2019st calm thyself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two of them argued, the ever-rising urge battle-lust led to the beginning of the duel.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, shall I go first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s more pressing work to be done after this. Don\u2019t push yourself too hard, come at me in a more relaxed way, old sir\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Without letting Momon finish, Palpatra instantly stepped in with a smoothness, speed and power that an 80 year-old man should not have possessed. In contrast, Momon had not even raised the staff in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014[Dragon Fang Thrust]!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran\u2019 eyes went wide as he saw Palpatra open with a martial art without the slightest bit of hesitation.</p><br/><p>The technique made his spear\u2019s shaft curve, allowing him to stab twice, like a Dragon\u2019s fang. In addition, it could deal elemental damage on top of that. This was a development of the martial art [Thrust], being a technique which Palpatra had apparently developed over 40 years ago, and it had become widely known due to its excellent balance. Many other warriors had learned that move up till this date.</p><br/><p>And among the [Dragon Fang Thrusts], Palpatra had chosen the [Blue Dragon Fang Thrust], with the additional effect of dealing electrical damage.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s that old coot thinking?! We might have healing magic on hand, but nobody would use a move like that under normal circumstances!</p><br/><p>A move like that, which could inflict electrical damage on the merest graze, was ideal for use against an armored opponent. Palpatra\u2019s use of that technique was a sign of how deadly serious he was.</p><br/><p>However, Momon easily avoided that strike, which would have otherwise been the bane of someone in armor. Even in his jet-black full plate armor, his movements were as graceful as a feather. More astounding was the fact that he had not leapt away, but remained in place and dodged it while hardly moving at all.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s impossible! What kind of dexterity and motion-tracking vision is that?!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014[Gale Acceleration].\u201d</p><br/><p>Palpatra continued using his martial arts.</p><br/><p>You\u2019ve gone too far, old man! Has your brain gone senile too?!</p><br/><p>\u201c[Dragon Fang Thrust]!\u201d</p><br/><p>He used the same move from before upon Momon again. Snow-white freezing vapors shrouded the spear\u2019s tip; it was the [White Dragon Fang Thrust].</p><br/><p>That lightning-fast series of four attacks\u2014</p><br/><p>A great commotion rose from the onlookers.</p><br/><p>That was only to be expected. After all, not a single one of those four attacks had managed to so much as touch Momon\u2019s armor.</p><br/><p>Palpatra leapt back. His forehead was beaded with sweat; he was not exhausted from attacking, but the mental strain of wielding his spear on deadly ground had been too much for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s incredible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014He\u2019s stronger than Hekkeran.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut of course, Arche. Don\u2019t compare me to him. He\u2019s what they call the highest-level adventurer, the peak of everything. That\u2019s the power of an adamantite-ranked adventurer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, I believe it is my turn next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Momon slowly raised his staff into a middle stance. In contrast, Palpatra took the spear he had been clutching and rested it on his shoulders. That was not a fighting stance; it was the posture of a man who had lost the will to fight \u2014 who had given up the battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was incredible. I give up. My skills can\u2019t even land a scratch on you, much less beat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Is that so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gasps of awe rose from the people watching by the side as Palpatra announced his surrender. It was a truly overwhelming display; they had all seen with their own eyes a difference like the one between children and adults.</p><br/><p>The crowd debated excitedly, discussing what school his dodging footwork hailed from and so on, sharing the emotions within their hearts. Hekkeran paid them no heed and took Gringam with him as they went over to Palpatra, who was wiping his sweat off as he spoke with Momon.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it over, old sir?\u201d</p><br/><p>Momon\u2019s tone and the air around him had turned gentle.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re about to show your true power now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Hyahyahya, my, you speak quite harshly to an old man. That was my true power just now. What you saw was the full extent of my abilities, Momon-dono.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Ah, forgive me. I was being rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease don\u2019t apologize. That would fill me with shame Also, you don\u2019t have to be so stiff when talking to me, because our worth isn\u2019t measured in our years, but in how skilled we are. Having an matchless man of power like yourself defer to me makes me feel a little itchy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I see, then I shall dispense with the formalities, however reluctantly. That said, I\u2019m not quite satisfied with ending things here. If we do get another chance, I\u2019d like to make the first move instead. Now then, I still have to help move the luggage into the carriage. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoving luggage is a trivial task; you could hand it to someone else, right? Surely this can\u2019t be your job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. No matter what position I may hold, I must still do the job assigned to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>With those words, Momon returned to the carriage, trailed by that beautiful girl. The two people who met them in passing watched them leave.</p><br/><p>They looked at his mighty back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHyahya, judging by your expressions, you seem to have something you want to ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Revered elder, what did thou think of that exchange?\u201d</p><br/><p>His wrinkled face twisted. It looked like a bitter smile, and at the same time like something else.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat man is very strong. No, as an adamantite-ranked adventurer, strength comes with the territory, but I honestly had not expected him to be that powerful. From the instant I faced him, I had the feeling that every blow I struck would be blocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran felt the same way. He had also felt that any attack he launched would have been easily blocked and promptly countered by the man called Momon. And even if everything had gone according to plan, he could imagine how his strikes would have been deflected by that armor. Palpatra had faced him head on, so surely he must have felt that even more intensely.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2026 is an adamantite-ranked adventurer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. That is an adamantite-ranked adventurer, one who belongs to a realm which only those favored by the heavens may dare to tread. Ahhh, what a matchless beauty, a pinnacle to which we cannot hope to aspire\u2026 \u2026 say, you must have been happy just to glimpse that peak, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed! Watching from the sidelines, I could see thy movements clearly. If I was facing him in person, surely I would not have been able to observe his skills so calmly. Personally \u2014 while this may offend thee, revered elder \u2014 I would have very much liked to see Momon-dono\u2019s strength as he went from the defense to the offense.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Momon-dono had no intention of attacking me at all, I couldn\u2019t sense any fighting spirit from him. It was probably like he said, he sucks at holding back. He must have felt that if he had actually struck at me, he could have easily taken my life.\u201d</p><br/><p>If that were the case, then one could say Momon\u2019s thinking was very arrogant. That was because the old man \u2014 Palpatra \u2014 was a skilled warrior, yet Momon had scorned him without so much as looking at his moves.</p><br/><p>However, it was because he could do such a thing that he could be called an adamantite-ranked adventurer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, the difference between his strength and mine is far too great. At first, I was unhappy too, but then he ended up taking the defense, and evading all my strikes. What could I say after that?\u201d</p><br/><p>That was what it meant to be strong.</p><br/><p>He had used a weapon which he was not familiar with \u2014 whose balance and weight were completely different from what he normally used \u2014 to show how confident he was. That was the difference between the two of them.</p><br/><p>Palpatra whined, \u201cAhhh, so tired, so tired,\u201d then turned his back on them and left. Naturally, he was headed for the carriage.</p><br/><p>As he watched Palpatra leave, Hekkeran heard a quiet grumble.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven when I was young, I could not step into that domain. So that\u2019s adamantite\u2026 what an unattainable peak\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Palpatra\u2019s back shrunk in his eyes. In contrast, Momon\u2019s back seemed massive, and oppressive.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026That is the highest rank, that of adamantite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. It\u2019s truly amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody around them could dispute their awed words.</p><br/><p>Part 2</p><br/><p>A carriage ran like the wind, over the paved roads of the Imperial Capital Arwintar.</p><br/><p>\uff0c\u3002</p><br/><p>The magical beast that pulled the luxurious carriage had eight legs \u2014 it was a Sleipnir. A pair of skilled-looking warriors occupied the driver\u2019s seat, while above the carriage\u2019s cabin \u2014 in a place modified from a cargo rack \u2014 were four magic casters and bow-wielding warriors, vigilantly watching their surroundings.</p><br/><p>The reason why such an excessive detachment of security personnel \u2014 like a mobile defensive formation \u2014 was travelling so boldly over the roads was immediately obvious once one saw who rode in the carriage.</p><br/><p>Anyone with the slightest bit of academic knowledge would immediately recognize the emblem of three crossed staves on the side of the carriage, and from there they would know who it belonged to and who rode within it. That was why the knights on guard duty by the roadside did not stop the carriage and its passengers for questioning.</p><br/><p>There were three men in the carriage. All of them were dressed in long robes, and they looked like magic casters.</p><br/><p>All three of them were renowned individuals within the Empire\u2019s magical society, but their attitudes showed the distinct differences in their status. The most highly-placed of them was a white-haired old man.</p><br/><p>Just as Gazef Stronoff was a famed warrior, when one spoke of magic casters, nobody\u2019s name echoed across the surrounding nations like this man did. This old man was the Empire\u2019s most powerful grand magic caster, \u201cTri-Arts\u201d Fluder Paradyne.</p><br/><p>Seated opposite Fluder were his adept disciples, who could use the fourth tier of magic.</p><br/><p>After leaving the Imperial Capital, an air of silence had filled the interior of the carriage. As though unable to bear the crushing pressure, one of his disciples nervously asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, what about his Majesty\u2019s orders?\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence filled the carriage once again, but only for a moment. Fluder replied in a calm, inscrutable voice:</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is his Majesty\u2019s will, and as his vassal I must investigate. However, doing so through magic is far too dangerous. We ought to start with researching the archives, then summon demons to gather information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that means you don\u2019t know either, Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder closed his eyes, then opened them a few seconds later.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately I have been too long isolated, and I have never heard of a mighty fiend named Jaldabaoth.\u201d</p><br/><p>A month ago, an army of demons had assaulted the Kingdom\u2019s capital. According to the information obtained, their commander Jaldabaoth and the maid demons attending him were incomprehensibly fearsome beings.</p><br/><p>This demonic disturbance had caused the Empire\u2019s knight corps \u2014 which invaded the Kingdom every year \u2014 to stay put. Normally, it was perfectly sensible in warfare to attack a beleaguered foe.</p><br/><p>However, the fact was that there were two main reasons for the Empire to make war upon the Kingdom.</p><br/><p>One of them was to indirectly exhaust the strength of the Kingdom. In contrast to the Empire\u2019s professional armed forces, the Kingdom employed conscription. Therefore, every time the Empire mobilized its troops, the Kingdom would have no choice but to rally the masses in order to make up for the shortfall of individual quality in their troops. For that reason, the Empire had embarked on a long-term plan: they declared war during the harvest season, forcing the Kingdom to gather its peasants and have them take the field. As a result, the peasants lacked the manpower needed for a proper harvest, which in turn damaged the Kingdom\u2019s agricultural output.</p><br/><p>Another reason for doing so was to weaken the strength of the nobles within the Empire. The nation would levy a special war tax on nobles who opposed the Emperor, making them cough up funds. If they refused to pay, they would be charged as traitors and stripped of their holdings. In the end, whether they were strangled to death or swiftly decapitated, the end came for them all the same.</p><br/><p>For these reasons, the Emperor \u2014 Jircniv \u2014 believed that once the Kingdom exhausted itself, the Empire would not need to force itself to go to war. After all, the nobles within the Empire were almost all toothless.</p><br/><p>However, one problem remained.</p><br/><p>Where had the wicked Jaldabaoth gone? What sort of being was he? It was all very disturbing.</p><br/><p>That was why he had ordered Fluder, the Empire\u2019s top magic caster to investigate Jaldabaoth. One could say it was only to be expected.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, there\u2019s Darkness\u2019 Momon \u2014 who defeated Jaldabaoth \u2014 and his companion, \u201cBeautiful Princess\u201d Nabe. Both of them are quite interesting. Then, there\u2019s the mysterious magic caster Ainz Ooal Gown. Have these hidden heroes finally decided to make their move? Perhaps there might be an intense battle like the one against the Demon Gods 200 years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Will there be one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet. However, only a fool would start preparing for it after it happened. The wise are always on watch against the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eventually, the carriage reached its destination.</p><br/><p>The sprawling grounds were encircled with thick, imposing walls, with watchtowers to keep an eye on both the inside and outside. Hand-picked knights from the 1st Legion \u2014 the most elite of the eight Imperial Knight Legions \u2014 were mixed with a number of magic casters into several security teams, which were in charge of surveillance.</p><br/><p>When one looked to the sky, one could even see members of the Emperor\u2019s own bodyguard, the Royal Air Guard, mounted on flying beasts, as well as high-tier magic casters using flight magic as they stood on watch.</p><br/><p>This place was the symbol of the Empire\u2019s power, into which the previous Emperor had channelled the greater part of his efforts and energies \u2014 the Imperial Ministry of Magic,.</p><br/><p>The production of magical equipment for the knights, the development of new spells, research into raising the standard of living through magical experiments and so on; all of these could be said to be the the essence of the Empire\u2019s magic, and they took place here. And the overall person in charge of this place \u2014 although the Ministry of Magic had no commanding officer \u2014 was Fluder.</p><br/><p>The carriage passed through the grounds, and finally stopped at a tower in the heart of the grounds.</p><br/><p>They had passed many strangely-shaped buildings on the way here, and many people had come and gone from each building, but there was hardly any movement of people in and out of this tower. However, in contrast, the security around this tower was much stiffer than that around the other buildings.</p><br/><p>For starters, the knights here were dressed differently. They were not the same as the First Legion knights in other places.</p><br/><p>They were sheathed in suits of enchanted full plate armor, carrying magic shields, and with magic weapons at their waists. Their crimson capes \u2014 which were embroidered with the emblem of the Empire \u2014 were also magic items, of course.</p><br/><p>While the enchantments on their gear were somewhat weak, ordinary knights could not wear such equipment, not even in the Empire. The most important thing was that ordinary knights would never be assigned to such a vital state institution.</p><br/><p>These ultra-elite knights were part of the Emperor\u2019s bodyguard, the Royal Earth Guard.</p><br/><p>The magic casters lined up here were no less impressive than the knights themselves. These experienced, valorous magic casters had the air of grizzled veterans around them.</p><br/><p>In addition, there were four Stone Golems, each over two and a half meters tall, guarding the entrance. They did not sleep and they did not rest and they did not eat, eternally focused on their duty as guardians.</p><br/><p>The security around this facility was as heavy as that defending the Emperor\u2019s own body, and only elite magic casters whose levels were in the upper reaches of the third tier or a very few research-oriented magic casters were permitted entry. Naturally, Fluder and his two disciples were permitted entry into this tower.</p><br/><p>The three of them raised their hands to acknowledge the knights and magic casters presenting arms to them, and then they entered the building. After walking through a straight passage, the three of them came to the upper level of a room shaped like a crucible. Many magic casters worked here. The highest-ranked of them hurriedly ran up to Fluder.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas there been any progress?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The disciples gulped, and his Adam\u2019s apple shifted. The usual answer had two meanings, good and bad.</p><br/><p>Fluder simply nodded, with a complex expression on his face, and then turned to the 30 disciples he had personally tutored \u2014 they were particularly famous disciples, known as the Chosen Thirty \u2014 and faced one of them, who was the assistant supervisor of this building.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so. You still haven\u2019t been able to induce a natural genesis, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed. Not even a Skeleton, the least of all undead, has appeared so far. Currently, we are placing corpses beside it in the hope of inducing the creation of Zombies.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder stroked his long beard, and then looked down at the sight beneath him.</p><br/><p>There were ten-odd Skeletons there, and they were tilling a field.</p><br/><p>Each Skeleton raised their hoe, then swung them down, in an identical manner to the one on either side of it. If one were to look at them from the side, their overlapping forms would seem like just a single Skeleton.</p><br/><p>This highly coordinated spectacle, which vaguely resembled a form of group exercise, was the true identity of the large-scale project which the Empire had been conducting. In other words, it was \u201cundead labor\u201d.</p><br/><p>The undead did not need to eat, drink or sleep, and they did not tire. In other words, they were the perfect workers. Granted, low-tier undead were unintelligent; they could only listen to orders, and they could not perform complex tasks. However, that problem could be solved by having someone stand by to supervise them every step of the way.</p><br/><p>The merits of ordering the undead to carry out tasks in a crop field had exceeded their expectations. The reduction of manpower costs had reduced the prices of crops, expanded the farms and fields, eliminated the risk of human-related damage and so on. It was truly a dream plan.</p><br/><p>There were other, similar plans, using summoned monsters and Golems instead, but after taking all factors into consideration, the undead were still the most cost-effective choice.</p><br/><p>However, there was still a reason why such a seemingly-perfect plam could not be put into practice on a large scale.</p><br/><p>That was because people opposed it \u2014 in particular, the factions led by the priests. They believed that creating undead, creatures of death which hated life, was an act which stained the soul.</p><br/><p>There were also problems from a religious perspective.</p><br/><p>They used the corpses of criminals to make undead, but the religious point of view was that a criminal\u2019s sin was paid off with the execution of their sentence. Going any further would be a form of blasphemy, and convincing then otherwise was a very difficult task.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they might be able to talk them round if the nation was facing a desperate food shortage and many people were starving to death However, the Empire\u2019s food stocks were ample, and they had no problems with manpower.</p><br/><p>For these reasons, the clergy opposed this plan.</p><br/><p>Ultimately, the true reason for this plan was to increase their military power. With the undead to handle production, they could divert their human resources elsewhere, potentially increasing the amount of talent for the knight corps and other fields.</p><br/><p>In addition, once undead labor became widespread, there were people who were worried that human laborers would be made redundant. In addition, the undead would not listen to humanity forever, and large amounts of undead might upset the balance of life and death and lead to the spontaneous genesis of more powerful undead. It was not just the priests, but anyone who heard of the plan that was unsettled by it.</p><br/><p>The reason for this facility\u2019s existence was to address each of these concerns and find a solution to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou haven\u2019t found the underlying reason yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Master. My deepest apologies, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did the undead arise by themselves? Exploring this fundamental reason would have a decisive influence on the future.</p><br/><p>There was a place which was perpetually shrouded in a light mist that only lifted when the Kingdom and the Empire did battle. That place was a cursed land, known as the Katze Plains. Undead appeared here at an alarmingly high rate, even Skeletal Dragons \u2014 some of the most powerful undead beings \u2014 who were immune to magic.</p><br/><p>Even if the Empire wanted to conquer the region around E-Rantel in the future, they did not want to have undead-spawning land in their domain. Thus, discovering the process by which the undead arose would definitely be an aid to rulership. Perhaps they might even find a way to keep the undead from spawning ever again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so, I understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistant supervisor bowed, grateful to have been spared a rebuke. Fluder walked past him, going in one big circle around the crucible-shaped room.</p><br/><p>By the time Fluder reached the door on the other side, there were more disciples behind him.</p><br/><p>The knights guarding the door pushed it open, and the group passed through it. Behind the door was a passage like the one just now, but it was much colder than the outside, and there was nobody around. The scent of dust hung in the air, and the light was losing its battle with the darkness that pressed in on it</p><br/><p>They walked along the corridor and its dread-filled atmosphere, and soon they came to a spiral staircase that extended downwards.</p><br/><p>They passed through many doors in the process, and they did not spend much time going clack clack clack down the spiral staircase; they were probably only five floors underground. Even so, the air was heavy, as though they were in a deeper place.</p><br/><p>This was not because they were underground. The best proof of that was that everyone \u2014 Fluder included \u2014 had a stiff expression on their faces.</p><br/><p>When they reached the bottom \u2014 an empty room \u2014 everyone had a grim set to their faces. They were visibly tense, perhaps even ready for battle.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes were fixed on the single, heavy door in the room. That door was filled with a sense of foreboding oppression, and it seemed to set this world apart from what lay beyond. In order to prevent its destruction or easy opening, the door was reinforced with several layers of physical and magical protection. This was a door which would not permit escape.</p><br/><p>In addition, the many sturdy doors they had passed through on the way here spoke of the danger behind this final door. If the threat behind this door stirred, those door-shaped walls could buy some time; in other words, they were effectively a seal.</p><br/><p>Fluder issued a warning to his disciple in a tense voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must not be careless.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a simple, terse statement, but that just made it all the more frightening.</p><br/><p>The magic casters accompanying him nodded deeply, as one. Fluder gave them the same warning every time they came here, but since they knew what lurked behind that door, their expressions had never once slacked off.</p><br/><p>That was because the ultimate undead was behind that door. If it was permitted to escape this place, it would spark a tragedy of unprecedented proportions in the Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>Several people began casting protective spells. These spells did not just defend against physical threats, but also included spells which protected the mind. After giving them ample time to prepare, Fluder looked around at his disciples\u2019 faces, and saw that they were filled with determination</p><br/><p>He nodded, and then uttered the keyword which would undo the seal.</p><br/><p>The heavy doors went thoom, and by the power of magic, they slowly opened.</p><br/><p>Chilly air spilled out of the darkened room, and several of his disciples shivered, as though they were very cold. Even with magic items that allowed them to adapt to the environment, the hatred of the living which emanated from the depths of the room was enough to chill their soul.</p><br/><p>The sound of someone swallowing seemed particularly resonant here.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Fluder\u2019s words, his disciples created several magical lights to disperse the darkness of the room. Yet, for some reason, it felt like the darkness was thicker and heavier beyond the light it had fled.</p><br/><p>Led by Fluder, the group entered the room which was filled with the odor of death.</p><br/><p>It was a small room, so the magical lanterns soon illuminated the room\u2019s innermost reaches.</p><br/><p>There stood a gigantic pillar which reached the ceiling. This tombstone-like pillar certainly attracted attention. But what truly held the eye was the entity that was crucified to it with thick and heavy chains.</p><br/><p>Each link of the chains which bound it was much thicker than a grown man\u2019s thumb, rendering it completely immobile. The chains were secured to the stony floor of the room. In addition, its arms and legs were hobbled with gigantic iron balls.</p><br/><p>No entity could so much as move a finger under these conditions. This excessively harsh method of binding instead showed how wary they were of this entity. Therefore, whenever someone in the group looked on the thick chains, they still felt uneasy. They feared that this creature would easily snap the chains and regain its freedom.</p><br/><p>From the outside, it looked like a knight in black full plate armor. However, there was a huge difference between it and a fully armored man.</p><br/><p>The first thing that caught the eye was its massive frame. Even a casual estimate of its height would put it above two meters in height.</p><br/><p>After that, there was its black full plate armor. The armor was covered in tracery that looked like blood vessels, and studded with brutal-looking spikes. A pair of demonic-looking horns sprouted from its helmet, and it exposed the face, which was a rotten human visage. Two crimson points of light shone from within the empty orbits of its eye sockets, formed of hatred for the living and a longing for massacre.</p><br/><p>It was not a living being, but one of the dead. Otherwise, it could not radiate such an intense hatred for the living.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath\u2026 Knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the disciples, who had come here for the first time, spoke the name of the legendary undead creature. Since it was a being of legends, it was not particularly well known.</p><br/><p>The red points of light within the Death Knight\u2019s eyes moved, sizing up all the magic casters like it was licking them with its gaze. No; they could not possibly see any movement from within those dancing masses of light. However, the spine-chilling terror made them feel that the death knight was looking right at them.</p><br/><p>The people who came here were all mighty individuals in their own right, each capable of casting third-tier spells at a minimum. Yet, even they could not stop the chattering of their teeth.</p><br/><p>Despite their spells to protect their minds, they could not stop the fear welling up from within them. Yet, the reason why they had pulled themselves together and not fled was probably because of their magical protections.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Be strong. The weak-willed will perish.\u201d</p><br/><p>After issuing his warning, Fluder approached the Death Knight. The Death Knight reacted to him; it radiated killing intent and began flexing its limbs.</p><br/><p>The chains groaned as the Death Knight struggled and pulled its bonds taut, and its body quivered.</p><br/><p>Fluder extended his hand straight at the Death Knight.</p><br/><p>His incantation reverberated through the darkened room, lit by magical light. This was a modified version of [Summon Undead 6th], an original spell penned by Fluder.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Obey me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The spell took effect \u2014 Fluder\u2019s quiet words flowed out and filled the room.</p><br/><p>However, the Death Knight\u2019s eyes were still filled with hatred for the living. Everyone knew the spell had failed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026So I still can\u2019t control it, even now?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a hint of regret within Fluder\u2019s voice. That was because he had tried to control this undead creature for the past five years, without success.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>They had discovered this monster in that place known for being haunted by the undead, the Katze Plains.</p><br/><p>The squad of Imperial knights who had first encountered this monster had never seen it before, but they were under orders, so they attacked it as per standard procedure. Several seconds later, they realized how rash and foolish they had been. The faces of those Imperial knights, known by all for their skill and bravery, were filled with fear and despair.</p><br/><p>They had been utterly and one-sidedly overwhelmed \u2014 their opposition was far too strong.</p><br/><p>After their foe mowed down countless knights like the passing of a violent gale, they finally realized that there was nothing they could do against it, and began to retreat.</p><br/><p>Of course, they could not just leave such a monster be, especially after personally witnessing the the murdered knights become undead beings, serving the monster as its minions. Clearly, the more time they gave their opponent, the worse the situation would become.</p><br/><p>After intensive debate among the Empire\u2019s leadership, they decided to open with their trump card; the most powerful fighting force in the Empire, which was to say they would mobilize Fluder and his adept disciples.</p><br/><p>And so, the Death Knight had been captured and imprisoned here, which was to say that the battle had ended with Fluder and company victorious. However, the reason why Fluder and the others had won was simply because the Death Knight had no way to fly. They launched a sustained area attack on it that was no different from carpet bombing \u2014 a repeated barrage of [Fireballs] from the air, which slowed the Death Knight\u2019s movements, and in the end Fluder, who had been mesmerized by its overwhelming power, had captured it intact.</p><br/><p>Currently, Fluder had imprisoned it here and gone through countless spells, countless magic items and countless means \u2014 searching through all the means which could control an undead being in order to control the Death Knight.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a shame\u2026 if only I could control this monster, I\u2019d be able to surpass that magic caster and become the greatest magic caster.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he succeeded, he would be far superior to the necromancer of the Thirteen Heroes, Rigrit Bers Carau.</p><br/><p>In truth, Fluder was not particularly interested in strength. His true ambition lay in peering into the abyss. This was just a step along that road.</p><br/><p>His disciples did not understand that, and so they began spouting misplaced consolation instead..</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster, you\u2019ve long since exceeded that hero.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly. The Thirteen Heroes are beings from the past; there\u2019s no way they can beat our Master, who stands at the pinnacle of modern magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also feel that Master has long since surpassed the Thirteen Heroes. However, if Master could take control of the Death Knight, the Empire would possess a source of incredible power.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s often said that an individual can\u2019t defeat a group, but that\u2019s just because the individual\u2019s too weak. That Death Knight is the most powerful individual around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder was standing at the head of the group, so none of them saw him smile bitterly to himself. Only the hate-filled eyes of the Death Knight saw it.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, if even Master cannot take control of it\u2026 then how powerful is that Death Knight, anyway?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 who knows? Theoretically speaking, it should be controllable. What are we missing? Does anyone have any ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group\u2019s answer to that was silence.</p><br/><p>The undead could be controlled through magic, and one of the Thirteen Heroes had done just that. Fluder\u2019s power was such that he could control undead beings of quite a high level. Perhaps he could even take control of the Death Knight before his eyes.</p><br/><p>However, that was simply theoretical. Actually controlling an undead being with magic involved more complex mechanisms. Fundamentally speaking, controlling or destroying the undead was the domain of the priests, who borrowed the power of the gods. Magic casters used arcane power to emulate divine might, so various discrepancies were only to be expected.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s not my intention to insult you, Master, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One of his disciples began cautiously with that, and Fluder bade him continue speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be you\u2019re simply not strong enough, Master? If magic of the 7th tier exists, then perhaps the Death Knight might require undead-summoning magic of that level in order to command it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is a good observation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the Adventurer\u2019s Guild often summarizes the data of various monsters and converts them into a difficulty rating. Perhaps that line of thought is worth pursuing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard those values are very crude and are essentially meaningless due to changes in body and age,\u201d another disciple said.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, other than unknown monsters, there\u2019s no metric which is easier to understand. After all, those values are based on combat feedback from adventurers and other forms of data; it can\u2019t be completely inaccurate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing by what you said, you still can\u2019t use it on a legendary-class monster like the Death Knight.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh yes, Master. Does that secret tome which records all manner of monsters mention that particular monster?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Fluder said while stroking his beard. Perhaps the complete version of the Eryuentiu might, but the only copies circulating in the outside world are not complete.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of his disciples seemed to have a question, which he addressed to a disciple next to him. While his voice was very soft, the room was the very embodiment of silence, and so his words seemed surprisingly loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the Eryuentiu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the name of a city?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that, but it sounds really weird.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHm\u2026 I looked it up once. I think it\u2019s a word from an ancient language which means, \u201cThe great tree at the heart of the world\u201d.</p><br/><p>Fluder rapped the floor with his staff, as a warning to his chatting disciples. This was a dangerous place which incarcerated a legendary-class monster. Carelessness was strictly forbidden.</p><br/><p>His disciples heeded the warning, and the master of the chamber (silence) ruled it once more, aside from the sounds of the Death Knight struggling against its chains in an attempt to break them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a shame. There\u2019s no need for us to stay here any longer. Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the chorus of relieved replies, Fluder strode away from the Death Knight with big steps.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Even someone like Fluder could not maintain the same pace leaving the room as he had when entering it. His steps quickened as he felt the Death Knight\u2019s vicious glare burning into his back. In that respect, his disciples were the same as him.</p><br/><p>As Fluder walked through the darkness, he recalled the word his disciples had mentioned just now.</p><br/><p>Eryuentiu.</p><br/><p>It was the capital of the kingdom founded by the Eight Greed Kings, and also its sole surviving city. At the same time, it was also a city defended by 30 city guardians equipped with magical arms and armor that surpassed conventional reason.</p><br/><p>It was said that there were magic items left behind by the Eight Greed Kings there, and with them, he would surely be able to vastly improve his own magical skills. Fluder thought. These incredible items had never fallen into anyone\u2019s hands, and only the Thirteen Heroes had been allowed to take several pieces away.</p><br/><p>A black flame flickered in Fluder\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The Thirteen Heroes; heroes of the past. Fluder\u2019s might ought to have been the equivalent of theirs, but only they had been granted that permission, while he had not. In what way did he not measure up to them?</p><br/><p>Fluder tried to put out the wavering fire in his heart, thinking of other things to reassure himself. His present position and all the things he had built were no less than what the Thirteen Heroes had done. No, among the Empire\u2019s magic casters, Fluder\u2019s status was greater even than the Thirteen Heroes.</p><br/><p>However, once that the black fire \u2014 the flame of jealousy \u2014 blazed up, it could not be easily extinguished, because what he envied was not their power, their knowledge, or their abilities, but rather, the fact that they had obtained a chance to peer into the abyss of magic.</p><br/><p>Fluder was a magic caster of the highest order; nobody would dispute that. The only people who could compare to him were the Thirteen Heroes of the past. However, he could not control the Death Knight, and of the ten tiers of magic that were said to exist \u2014 although the reliability of that information was a little low \u2014 he could only cast spells of up to the sixth tier.</p><br/><p>This situation was a stark reminder that he was far from the abyss of magic.</p><br/><p>Fluder was old.</p><br/><p>Among the sage arts he had learned as a spiritual magic caster was a certain branch known as the forbidden arts. He had used this forbidden magic to stop his aging. Of course, given the level of magic Fluder had mastered, using that spell was very difficult. In the end, he had barely managed to cast it with a ritual spell.</p><br/><p>However, since this was a twisting of the impossible into the possible, it had been distorted. The spell which should have granted immortality if perfectly cast instead allowed Fluder to experience, ever so slightly, the passage of time.</p><br/><p>He could still handle it now. However, the distortion would grow larger, and eventually there would be a weakness in it.</p><br/><p>Indeed. Fluder would die before he could gaze into the abyss of magic.</p><br/><p>Perhaps if a skilled predecessor had guided him, he might have been able to reach his current position sooner. However, there had been nobody ahead of him, so all he could do was blaze his own trail.</p><br/><p>Fluder nonchalantly looked at the disciples around him.</p><br/><p>He looked around at the people who walked along the trail Fluder had blazed.</p><br/><p>It was fuel to the fire of his jealousy, which blazed even more fiercely.</p><br/><p>He\u2026 as the most knowledgeable person present, how old had he been when he had been at his disciples\u2019 level? No, there was no need to think about it; he would surely have been older than his disciples were. That was how great the difference was without anybody to guide him, without anybody to show him the way.</p><br/><p>Why did he not have a Master of his own?</p><br/><p>Fluder tried to think in a different direction to mask the complaints he often had.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u2014it was fine, right? He would go down in history as a forerunner. Every single magic caster would give thanks to Fluder for the results he had left behind, which were derived from the trail he had blazed. These pupils are my treasure; so long as any of them reaches a greater height than myself, it will be a part of my accomplishments too\u2014</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Fluder thought of one of his disciples while consoling himself. That disciple had long since departed his side.</p><br/><p>What tier could that girl have reached?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Arche Eeb Ryle Furt.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was an excellent girl. She had mastered the second tier of magic at a young age, and even begun her first steps upon the third. So long as she continued training, she might well have been able to reach Fluder\u2019s domain. But regretfully, at the end, she had abandoned her studies for some reason\u2026</p><br/><p>Fluder had been utterly disappointed back then. All the could think of was that she had been terribly foolish.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a shame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps she had been the one that got away.</p><br/><p>Where was that girl now? Fluder thought, perhaps I could try and find her. If she can use magic of the third tier, perhaps I could give her a good position.</p><br/><p>That said, there were still things which had to be done.</p><br/><p>Fluder incanted the command word, and opened the heavy door.</p><br/><p>After that, he exited the room, and took several deep breaths with his disciples. That was because the air in the Death Knight\u2019s room was heavy with the stench of its presence, and it felt like the air would not enter their lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>A low, coarse voice called out to him. There stood one of his adept disciples, who was also a famous male adventurer. Due to the breadth of his experience, he was the second-in-command of the Ministry of Magic\u2019s security forces.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026What happened? Is there an emergency?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, not an emergency. Two adamantite-ranked adventurers desire an audience with you, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fluder looked upon the man with suspicion.</p><br/><p>He had not arranged for a meeting with anyone. Fluder was the highest-ranked magic caster in the Empire. He had a lot of work to do, and then he needed to conduct his own magical research on top of that; he simply did not have any free time. He could not simply nod when someone said they wanted to meet him. In the Empire, only the Emperor could see him without making an appointment in advance.</p><br/><p>That said, he could not summarily reject the request. Adamantite-ranked adventurers were heroes. They were individuals, but they were not beings he could simply overlook. The same applied even for a great magic caster like Fluder. At times, he would request them to help him find exotic objects, so he could not just ignore them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they from Silver Canary? Or Eight Ripples?\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke the names of the Empire\u2019s two adamantite-ranked adventurer teams.</p><br/><p>However, his disciple shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. They are a duo calling themselves Darkness. They even produced adamantite plates to prove their identity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The adventurer team Darkness\u2019 name was well known throughout the Kingdom. Even with just two members, they had accomplished many heroic deeds. Apparently, they had recently challenged Jaldabaoth, who had caused havoc in the Royal Capital, and fought him off.</p><br/><p>Why would people like that come to see him? Several questions appeared in his heart, but more than that, he wanted to discuss magical knowledge with the \u201cBeautiful Princess\u201d Nabe, said to be a very high-level magic caster. He immediately cast his doubts to the back of his mind.</p><br/><p>However, he was the Emperor\u2019s servant, after all, and he remembered that his lord Jircniv wanted to see them.</p><br/><p>He would bring the matter up after their meeting. Fluder gave orders to his disciples as he thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cShow them the way. I will tidy myself up and head over immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Part 3</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! I didn\u2019t expect there to actually be ruins! What a shock. While I thought that it probably wouldn\u2019t be a lie, given the sizable payout, I can\u2019t believe there was actually an unexplored ruin smack in the middle of a grass plain like this. Really surprising, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As they heard Hekkeran ask that, his comrades responded with their agreement</p><br/><p>Apparently, this was a tomb of some sort, but when they actually saw it, it seemed to be sunk into the earth itself \u2014 as though something had pressed it down, like a basin.</p><br/><p>One possible reason why ruins like these had not been explored was because the surrounding land was grass as far as the eye could see, with no remains of ancient cities nearby to draw adventurers\u2019 attention. In addition, small hillocks of dirt were scattered around it like stars in the sky, so even if there were ruins buried in one of them, they would have missed it. The central building protruded a little, but one could only see it after climbing to a high vantage like this.</p><br/><p>Part of the dirt wall surrounding the ruins had collapsed, exposing part of the walls, which was how the ruins had been discovered. That was the shared opinion of the various teams.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo doubt about it. In truth, I\u2019m quite excited about this. After all, unexplored ruins might contain startling treasures.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s a bit hard to say, but given that there haven\u2019t been any problems for the area around the ruins, it\u2019s pretty clear that there aren\u2019t any dangerous monsters within. More than that, I\u2019m more uneasy that our client actually specified a location for a base camp.\u201d</p><br/><p>The campsite was situated on the plains. One could say it was an ideal location.</p><br/><p>Since it was surrounded by scattered hillocks, which blocked line of sight, they did not have to worry about being spotted from afar. All they had to do was be mindful of the light from their fires and torches, and it would be very hard for others to spot them.</p><br/><p>And because of that \u2014 he was afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did our client know about this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>The most likely answer was that the client had searched for an ideal location for a campsite around here for some reason. That would explain a lot.</p><br/><p>But if that were the case, it would raise more questions in turn. For instance, why had the client thought of having them camp in such a secluded spot, and why would an Imperial noble enter the Kingdom\u2019s territory?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014I once heard that there was a massive criminal organization in the Kingdom, called Eight Fingers, if I\u2019m not wrong. They say that organization did a lot of evil things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard they even did smuggling to the Empire. Some of my thief friends complained that they were really influential in the Kingdom, so investigating them would cause a lot of problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Imina pressed down her wind-tossed hair and spoke after Arche finished. Roberdyck spoke in quiet tones, like he was spitting on the ground:</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard about their drugs. When used properly, medicines can be very helpful. But these people turn medicine into narcotics, which they sell to and use to harm the weak. I find that very displeasing.\u201d</p><br/><p>That he raised his voice slightly could not be helped. After all, Roberdyck had become a Worker to help the weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough talk of all this idle fantasy that has nothing to do with the job. According to Arche\u2019s research, our client isn\u2019t doing anything dubious, but might be the subject of a purge, is he not?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps I didn\u2019t investigate thoroughly enough, or it was very well hidden,\u201d Arche said quietly. However, Hekkeran paid it no heed, and looked to the others for confirmation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I think everyone understands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Don\u2019t mention that in front of the other teams. After all, Workers sometimes get requests from Eight Fingers for smuggling. We won\u2019t shoot our mouths off if there\u2019s a chance any of the other teams might be involved with that group. At least, until we\u2019re done with this job.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, there\u2019s no telling how many people\u2019s tears went into our payment, and how dirty it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Even if the money\u2019s dirty, a payout is still a payout, and you can survive on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Roberdyck glanced at Arche, then inhaled and exhaled deeply to cool himself down.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014My apologies, I was being rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I almost said something rude myself. Please forgive me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Please don\u2019t worry about it, because you didn\u2019t actually say anything. I just wanted you to know that was how I thought about it. I\u2019m not looking for spiritual fullness, but material satisfaction. However\u2026 \u201c Arche quickly raised her hand, to indicate she was not done yet. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my best to avoid doing things that harm my companions, because I\u2019ve seen many people who destroyed themselves in pursuit of their desires.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you, Arche.\u201d</p><br/><p>Arche nodded, and nobody said anything to her. The message had been passed even without speaking. They had all argued with each other several times in the past, and they had long since built up a relationship of mutual trust.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what do you guys think? I feel that the tomb might be ruled by some kind of entity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran\u2019s eyes carefully studied the cut grass. That aside, the angel and goddess statues positioned all over the place were very intricately carved, making onlookers gasp in awe. It was evident at a glance that they had been regularly maintained.</p><br/><p>In contrast, the trees standing everywhere around the graveyard were twisted and drooping, creating a gloomy atmosphere. There was no order in the way the tombstones were arranged, sticking up from the ground like the teeth of some ugly witch. They felt very out of place in contrast to the cleaned portions.</p><br/><p>Someone was in charge of this place. However, that someone was not a normal person, went the frightening conjecture which rose from the pit of his stomach.</p><br/><p>In order to banish the chill that ran through him, Hekkeran turned his attention to the huge building. There was a mausoleum in the north, south, east and west of the graveyard interior, and in the center was a magnificent mausoleum. Eight tall warrior statues were positioned around the great mausoleum. They radiated an oppressive feeling, as though they were intent on eliminating all threats and evildoers who came near the mausoleum.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe vegetation in the graveyard\u2019s been neatly trimmed. There isn\u2019t even a trace of algae here, so someone must be taking good care of it. But what kind of person are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, each team \u2014 Tenbu aside \u2014 had felt something was amiss when they researched the records about the job.</p><br/><p>Looking around at the place itself, what they saw was plains and more plains. It was singularly unsuited to building a tomb.</p><br/><p>For starters, one had to consider the convenience factor. Building such a luxurious tomb in such a deserted place made no sense at all; it was far too inconvenient.</p><br/><p>It would be understandable if this was not to honor the dead, but to serve as a memorial to future generations. After all, people sometimes built monuments upon places where great deeds took place.</p><br/><p>However, in that case, the fact that this great accomplishment had not been passed down in history felt entirely unnatural. All the teams had shared the information they had gathered, but there was no relevant data among it, which indicated that this ruin might have been erased from history.</p><br/><p>It all seemed highly irregular.</p><br/><p>There was a bizarre sensation, like something stuck in his throat, and it made him furrow his brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, there might be a big incident depending on who\u2019s staying in the ruins. Have you checked up on that yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I just hope they\u2019re not innocent people.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014The brains of the various teams put their heads together just now, and they said that the Guild doesn\u2019t know anything about ruins in this area. It\u2019s also far from the nearby villages, so it\u2019s not likely that there\u2019ll be commoners around. If there\u2019s anyone here, then they\u2019ll be illegal squatters \u2014 the kind who can\u2019t show their faces in public \u2014 or monsters. Since there\u2019s no traces of footprints exiting the ruins, what we came up with was that either the creatures inside don\u2019t need to eat or drink, or the interior of the ruins are self-sustaining. However, since we know too little, we\u2019re limited to stereotypes for further theorycrafting, which might lead to our thinking being constrained. That\u2019s where we left our consideration of the ruins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once people discovered a set of ruins, news about it would be disseminated to various government organizations through the Adventurer\u2019s Guild, and the first people to discover it would have investigation rights for a limited period. Under that arrangement, those people who discovered ruins which had been previously unknown to the nation or the Adventurer\u2019s Guild had unspoken permission to kill any illegal squatters occupying the ruins.</p><br/><p>In that respect, they had adopted a policy of \u201ckill them on suspicion\u201d.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this was a very brutal policy, but humans were weak creatures in this world. Therefore, beings of unknown provenance occupying territory at the edge of human lands would be very troublesome.</p><br/><p>The fact was, roughly 20 years ago, there had been a group called Zuranon which occupied a set of ruins, performed frightening experiments, and caused a major disaster. An entire city had been destroyed while everyone had sat back and watched due to a lack of information.</p><br/><p>The Guild made that rule in order to prevent the same kind of mistakes from happening again.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, under normal circumstances, it\u2019d probably be the undead. If the undead really have taken over these ruins, then we\u2019ll need to clear them out and consecrate the place to disperse the negative energy, else it\u2019ll be bad, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike you said, it would be very bad. Leaving the undead be will only lead to the appearance of more powerful undead. That\u2019s why powerful undead often appear in places like ruins and so on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would save a lot of trouble if they were just Golems tidying up the ruins on orders from their previous masters. Then, what do you plan to do after this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014I think Hekkeran should attend the meeting in my place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, the other team leaders didn\u2019t take part either, right? This is called making full use of one\u2019s resources, mm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran winked at Arche, and she sighed with deliberate loudness.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014In any case, all the teams will move in after dark. We\u2019ll enter from four directions at once and meet up at the central mausoleum.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, because we\u2019ll be spotted more easily when entering in the day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Correct.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding terrain was open, and there were no signs of observers or travellers. Thus, entering directly was also a valid option, but they had to be on watch against unexpected situations. It was somewhat safer to move around in the dark.</p><br/><p>Besides, they might still be able to learn something if they continued observing the ruins, though they only had until nightfall. This job was under time constraints, but it would not hurt to spend some time here. That was probably what the smart people thought.</p><br/><p>Perhaps they really wanted to continue observing the place for several more days.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, can\u2019t we scout safely with [Invisibility]?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014I\u2019d thought of that as well. However, since a troublesome situation might arise, it would be better to go in all at once, so at least we\u2019d be able to learn something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Invisibility spells were not perfect; there were many ways to see through them. If the Workers approached with magic, and they were spotted by someone \u2014 by the tomb\u2019s sentries \u2014 it would raise their alertness level, and they might not be able to enter at all for the next few days.</p><br/><p>In order to avoid that, they opted for a plan where everyone would go in together.</p><br/><p>Hekkeran understood that point and nodded. While there were still some holes in the plan, this was the best balance they could strike between risk and effectiveness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, we\u2019ll be resting for now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Yes, Darkness and Screaming Whip will be in charge of security; but for safety\u2019s sake and to keep everyone on their toes, the various teams will be assigning sentries to keep an eye on things. We\u2019re going in order of arrival at the Count\u2019s estate and rotating every two hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so we\u2019re the last, then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Yes, it\u2019ll be a while before it\u2019s our turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying so, Arche cricked her neck and worked her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for your hard work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Arche nodded to Roberdyck.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014I\u2019m so tired. We spent so much time because that idiot wanted to just barge into the ruins. It took us a lot of time to talk him down. That man doesn\u2019t know the meaning of teamwork at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ah, that sword genius guy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust call him Goddamn Son-of-a-bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran smiled to Imina \u2014 whose murderous intent was steaming off her \u2014 and tried to change the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll be heading back to the campsite to slowly wait our turn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI approve. I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll rain for a while, but we\u2019d best prepare just in case. Imina-san, it\u2019s your turn, so please try not to look so scary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine. Ahhhh~ it just pisses me off! I want to stab him to death. I\u2019m pitching my tent away from them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you stay within the designated campgrounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was not actually a good thing, but it was much better than pitching a tent nearby and then getting into a fight.</p><br/><p>The four of them turned their backs on the ruins and left the plains.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Still, the more I think about it, the stranger it seems. No wonder the Count put out a request like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group turned around as they heard Arche\u2019s voice, and saw her staring at the ruins.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell the age or the background of these ruins at all. It\u2019s as though they just suddenly appeared in this era. It feels out of place. Those carvings look just like the carvings in the region before the Demon Gods rampaged through this area, but those carvings had an eastern flavor to them. And then there\u2019s these cross-shaped tombstones\u2026 no, I still don\u2019t get it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he listened to Arche\u2019s scholarly dissertation, Hekkeran had to suppress the wicked smile on his face and he barely managed to hide the excitement in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that we might find some very interesting treasure there, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be some amazing treasure in there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Either that, or some very frightening undead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Uwah~ how scary~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014That\u2019s a horrible imitation, Hekkeran. It doesn\u2019t look like me at all. And you\u2019re trying to copy my voice too, that\u2019s just gross.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, sorry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill\u2026 I\u2019m kind of looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes. Why does this tomb exist, and who was buried here? It piques my curiosity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Exploring the unknown always gets me a little jumpy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014And money. I hope there\u2019s a lot of treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran looked at the smiling faces of his companions, and satisfaction filled his heart. While everyone here had done dirty jobs for money, it was not of their own free will. In truth, everyone here preferred adventurer work.</p><br/><p>There was no telling if Arche would be able to continue adventuring with them once she had to start supporting her sisters. Once Arche left the team, it might take a while to find their next member, and even if they found one, they would have to take on easier jobs before they blended into the team.</p><br/><p>Perhaps this job, as the last one with their current members, was the best choice.</p><br/><p>In the future\u2026 maybe we can take adventuring jobs\u2026 like adventurers, no, it would be good if we could go explore the unknown together.</p><br/><p>Hekkeran looked to the heavens, at the sprawling, boundless sky.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>As sunset slowly shrouded the world, the Workers filed out of their cleverly-concealed low tents. As the ones charged with carrying out clandestine operations, it was time for them to work.</p><br/><p>The adventurers had already prepared a meal for them.</p><br/><p>They started by lighting several white bricks of solid fuel, then added charcoal to it. Since they had cast [Darkness] on the fire beforehand, there was no illumination which would otherwise have lit up the surroundings. [Darkness] only eliminated light; it did not extinguish flames. Then, they boiled the water from a Pouch of Infinite Water over the lightless, yet vigorous blaze.</p><br/><p>They poured the boiled water into wooden bowls, and the travel rations within lost their shape, and a fragrant smell of soup steamed forth. That, along with hard bread, was what everyone ate.</p><br/><p>After that, it was up to personal preference.</p><br/><p>The bowls were filled with yellowish soup \u2014 the type which Workers liked, made to provide nutrition and to be stored for a long time. Some people would add thin slices of jerky to the soup, some sprinkled spices onto it, and others would simply consume it straight.</p><br/><p>Dinner was over with that bowl of soup. When one considered the amount of activity they would soon be performing, it seemed like a pitiful amount.</p><br/><p>However, eating too much would affect their upcoming work, At the same time, not eating enough was also dangerous, because there was no telling when they would be able to eat again.</p><br/><p>Their supply of emergency ration bars was also limited, because carrying too many would hinder movement. A compromise had to be made in this area.</p><br/><p>They handed the empty bowls to the adventurers, and then the Workers shouldered their pre-packed bags.</p><br/><p>Under the watchful eyes of the adventurers, the Workers set off in unison. The adventurers would be guarding this campsite, and they would not follow them to the ruins.</p><br/><p>To begin with, they circled around the base of the hill, and then dispersed around the ruins. They had already arranged to launch a flare into the sky if they were attacked at this stage.</p><br/><p>Many people wore full plate armor, whose cumbersome bulk and noise did not seem quite suitable for stealth operations, but that was only within the constraints of normal thinking. For those who could use magic to violate common sense, it was a trivial matter.</p><br/><p>First, they cast [Silence]. This spell smothered all sounds within a certain distance, be it the clanking of armor plates or that of running across the ground.</p><br/><p>After that was [Invisibility]. That spell made it difficult for observers to detect them with the naked eye.</p><br/><p>For safety\u2019s sake, they had a ranger in the air with [Invisibility], [Fly] and [Hawk Eye] cast on him to keep an eye on their surroundings. He was equipped with special arrows imbued with a paralysis effect to deal with any sudden situation that might develop.</p><br/><p>The group reached their destination under this double layer of protection.</p><br/><p>It was time for the main event.</p><br/><p>Their plan was to ascend the slope, then drop down onto the ruins several meters below. Then, they would search the surface portion and then meet up at the central mausoleum. All this had to be done while the [Invisibility] spells were still in effect.</p><br/><p>That said, everyone had to move in sync in order to keep people from going off-script. However, it was late at night, and everyone was invisible, so it would be very difficult to verify each other\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>However, they had already taken that problem into consideration.</p><br/><p>Strange sticks, each about 30 centimeters long, suddenly appeared on the ground. The sticks floated into the air like someone was holding them, and after they were bent, they glowed dimly.</p><br/><p>These special sticks \u2014 glowsticks \u2014 could be bent, upon which the alchemical solutions within would combine and emit light. The reason why they had been dropped to the ground was because [Invisibility] also affected everything the subject of the spell was carrying. In order to keep an item visible, it had to be removed from the subject\u2019s person.</p><br/><p>The light shook back and forth a few times, and then the sticks broke, having served their purpose.They then poured glowing alchemical solution onto the ground and covered it up with dirt, neatly concealing it.</p><br/><p>In this way, they learned that things were going smoothly for the Workers everywhere, and that they were waiting for the next stage of the plan.</p><br/><p>While they could not see each other due to the distance, four ropes were simultaneously lowered to the surface of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. This was climbing rope, and it had knots tied at regular intervals along its length.</p><br/><p>The ends of the rope were tied to iron pitons sunk into the rock, and they creaked as they swayed.</p><br/><p>If anyone present could see through invisibility, they would be able to see a group of people descending the ropes.</p><br/><p>This much was nothing even for someone like Arche, who had focused on honing her magical prowess over her physical body and had not learned much in the way of athletic skills, Or rather, it would be better to say that both Workers and adventurers needed at least that much physical training.</p><br/><p>The training and the knots were put to good use as each Worker descended without a problem, landing within the tomb grounds.</p><br/><p>The first destination of each infiltration team was one of the four smaller mausoleums in each direction.</p><br/><p>Now that the effective duration of [Invisibility] was over, everyone came into view again. Each team ran towards their respective mausoleum.</p><br/><p>They were crouched low, concealing themselves with tombstones, trees or statues, running through the darkened graveyard. During this time, the [Silence] spell was still in effect, so they did not make any noise, and even the warriors in full plate ran with all their might while seeking cover. Their movements were swift and fluid, like shadows racing across the land.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Heavy Masher\u2019s leader Gringam slowly approached the mausoleum, and his eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>That was because the mausoleum was grander than he had imagined.</p><br/><p>While it was one of the smaller directional mausoleums, that was only in comparison to the huge central mausoleum. At a closer look, the structure was so impressive that its incredible grandeur made the breath catch in his throat.</p><br/><p>The white stone walls gleamed like they had been planed flat. Many years should have passed since it had been built, yet there was no trace of weathering or stains from the wind and the rain.</p><br/><p>A massive steel door stood atop a flight of three steps made from single slabs of rock. The door itself was polished and free of rust, and glinted with a dark, metallic light.</p><br/><p>Just seeing this structure was enough to tell them how well it had been maintained.</p><br/><p>\u2014In other words, the tomb was definitely occupied.</p><br/><p>As Gringam reached that conclusion, the thief among his companions stepped forward, and began inspecting the steps.</p><br/><p>Gringam saw the thief gesture to him \u2014 because of the [Silence] spell \u2014 to move away from him, and so he slowly backed off. This was to avoid being caught in an area-effect trap.</p><br/><p>The thief checked very carefully. It was somewhat frustrating, but it could not be helped.</p><br/><p>Apparently, people\u2019s souls resided in their bodies, and when the body started to decay, the soul would be summoned to the side of the gods. That was why the dead were essentially buried in graveyards right away \u2014 in the embrace of the earth \u2014 but this was different for certain nobles and those in power.</p><br/><p>If one buried the body right away, verifying the decay of the body would require an exhumation of the grave. Therefore, in order to personally verify the decay of the deceased, these powerful people would not be buried immediately after death, but left in state for a while. However, nobody would choose to put their corpses in their own homes.</p><br/><p>Instead, they would choose to have their bodies stored in the mausoleums of the graveyards. The corpse would be placed there for a period of time, and once the decay began, the priests would bear witness to the fact that the soul had, in fact, departed the body to be with the gods.</p><br/><p>The bodies in question would be placed within a communal space within the mausoleum. There would be several stone slabs within a wide-open space and the corpses would be laid out on the slabs. The sight of rotting cadavers laid out in a row ought to have been a gruesome sight, but within this world\u2019s frame of reference, it was an exceedingly normal sight.</p><br/><p>However, if one were as wealthy and powerful as a Great Noble, things would once again be slightly different. They would not use a communal mausoleum, but an ancestral tomb. People believed that these were temporary resting places for the mighty to abide before they were summoned before the spirits of their family, and so being able to possess a family mausoleum was a symbol of power.</p><br/><p>It was not at all unusual to decorate mausoleums with furniture or jewellery. In other words, mausoleums were essentially treasure troves for thieves. Therefore, these places were typically fortified with lethal traps and the like to ward off intruders.</p><br/><p>Therefore, such a magnificent mausoleum must surely be laced with even more dangerous traps</p><br/><p>After checking the steps, the thief began inspecting the door, and then suddenly, the sounds around them returned to normal.</p><br/><p>The duration of the [Silence] had expired, perhaps just in time. The thief quietly crept towards the door, and began checking again. In the end, he rested something like a cup against the door, and tried listening to what was beyond it.</p><br/><p>After several seconds, the thief turned to Gringam and company and shook his head.</p><br/><p>In other words: \u201cthere\u2019s nothing\u201d.</p><br/><p>The thief himself was quite surprised, and tilted his neck several times.</p><br/><p>The door was not even locked, which defied understanding, but since the thief had not found anything, it would be the frontliner\u2019s turn after this.</p><br/><p>Gringam stepped up, and reached out to push the door which the thief had already oiled. The warrior behind him braced his shield as well.</p><br/><p>With a forceful shove, the heavy door began moving. Perhaps it was the oil, or because the people in charge of this place had been very meticulous in their work, but the door slid open smoothly despite its massive weight.</p><br/><p>The warrior standing by moved between the freshly-opened door and Gringam, bracing his shield forward, so Gringam would not be hit by an attack or trap.</p><br/><p>No arrows or the like flew at him. The metal door was now completely open, and a vacuous darkness appeared before the members of Heavy Masher.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Continual Light].\u201d</p><br/><p>The staff which the arcane magic caster was holding glowed with magical light. Through its variable, controllable illumination, they had a clear view of the mauseoleum\u2019s interior. The magic caster incanted another spell, and the warrior\u2019s weapon glowed as well.</p><br/><p>The twin sources of light illuminated what looked like a chamber belonging to a member of royalty.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the room was what looked like a religious altar, upon which was placed a white stone sarcophagus. Said sarcophagus was over 2.5 meters long and it was inscribed with delicate patterns. In the four corners of the room were white statues of warriors in armor and carrying swords and shields.</p><br/><p>And also\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014Hm, does anyone know anything about that emblem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019ve never seen anything like that before.\u201d</p><br/><p>A flag hung from the wall. It had a strange crest stitched on it in thread-of-gold. The thief and the magic caster knew most of the heraldry used by the surrounding nations, so if they did not recall this particular crest, then it probably did not belong to the Kingdom\u2019s royalty.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be an emblem from nobles before the Kingdom was founded?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThou meanst this is a relic from over two centuries ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Many countries had been destroyed by the Demon Gods 200 years ago, and so there were surprisingly few nations around here whose history lasted beyond 200 years. The Kingdom, the Holy Kingdom, the Council Alliance and the Empire had all been founded within the past 200 years.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s really the case, then what exactly is this flag made of, to remain in the same beautiful shape despite its age?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe someone used preservation magic on it, or someone used magic to repair the aged portions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Say, leader, you don\u2019t need to talk in that weird way any more. We\u2019re the only ones here now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUmu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gringam\u2019s eyebrows bent to a dangerous angle, and then his face promptly broke into a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhh, what a pain, thou this and meanst that, it\u2019s all so stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks for your hard work. Still, he\u2019s right; when it\u2019s just us, you can speak normally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I can\u2019t! Speaking stiffly and formally like that makes me sound more like a great Worker. And besides, changing the way I speak here and there is a pain in the ass, so I always speak like that on the job. That\u2019s one of my principles; you know that, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gringam answered his companions\u2019 bitter smiles with a wry grin of his own.</p><br/><p>Gringam had originally been the third son of a farmer in the Kingdom.</p><br/><p>If farmers evenly divided their fields between each and every one of his child over the generations, then the fields would shrink, which in turn would cause the crop yield to dwindle until the family line ended. Therefore, as the saying went, \u201cdividing the fields\u201d became synonymous with \u201cfoolishness\u201d. Because of that, the fields of a farming family typically went to the eldest son, while the second son could choose to help with the housework and the fields, but the third son would be nothing but a waste of space. Therefore they typically chose to leave their homes and eke out a living in the city.</p><br/><p>It was true that Gringam was blessed with exceptional physical abilities and friends, with which he had made a name for himself. However, he had originally been a farmer, and he was a second-rate piece of insurance to ensure the family line continued at that, so he had no education. He could neither read nor write, and he did not understand etiquette.</p><br/><p>It was true that Workers needed the strength to complete their jobs, and not education. However, there would be problems if he, as their leader, was ignorant.</p><br/><p>He did his best to study, but his mind was not as capable as his body, and he messed everything up. Even so, the reason why he had not been removed from his position as leader was because his comrades approved of his performance, academic abilities aside. In order not to disgrace these friends of his, Gringam had chosen to speak in a weird way.</p><br/><p>This would let their clients feel, \u201cHe\u2019s advertising for his team, so there\u2019s nothing strange about him talking in a funny way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact was that people laughed at him for speaking in that way. However, it was far better than letting others say, \u201cA team led by a clueless farmboy won\u2019t amount to much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, we have tarried sufficiently. Let us be off, gentlemen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody objected to Gringam\u2019s declaration, and so they continued onward.</p><br/><p>At their head was the thief, who carefully entered the mausoleum and searched the interior.</p><br/><p>The other team members wedged stout iron bars into the gaps of the door. That way, no matter what kind of traps they sprang, the door would not close completely. After that, they half-closed the doors to prevent light from escaping the interior. While the thief carefully inspected the inside of the mauseleum, Gringam and the others kept a close eye on their surroundings, taking pains not to slack off. While it was necessary, they had still made light. Someone might have spotted it.</p><br/><p>As Gringam hunkered down to watch the surroundings outside, the thief had already reached the bottom of the flag. After carefully examining the flag, he made up his mind to touch it, and in the instant he did, he immediately shrank away from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay for now, so come in, everyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The thief looked back, and after seeing that Gringam and company had entered the mausoleum, he pointed to the flag.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026This ought to be worth a pretty penny; it\u2019s been woven from threads of precious metal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhhaaaaaat?! Threads of precious metal? Are they mad, to hang such a thing here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone exclaimed in surprise. Then, they rushed to the base of the flag and took turns to feel it up. The cold sensation was undoubtedly that of metal.</p><br/><p>From the way it gleamed, the thief was probably correct. A flag of that size ought to be very heavy, and after factoring its artistic worth, it must be worth a fortune.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would seem our client\u2019s bet paid off. While he has not yet made back the payment to us\u2026 no, to our four teams, there must surely be much treasure in a place like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we going to take it with us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gringam replied to the thief:</p><br/><p>\u201cT\u2019would be too bulky, and most weighty. We shall collect it later. Does anyone disagree?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, carrying this around really would weigh us down. Also, I\u2019ve searched this place; there\u2019s no traps here, or secret doors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then, I shall leave it to thee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gringam nodded to the arcane magic caster \u2014 the wizard \u2014 and his colleague cast a spell in response.</p><br/><p>\u201c[Detect Magic] \u2014 I can\u2019t sense any magical mechanisms around, unless they\u2019re hidden by concealing spells.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Then there is nothing else to inspect. Let us continue with our prime directive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes went to the sarcophagus in the center of the room.</p><br/><p>The thief spent a long time inspecting it, and judged that there were no traps.</p><br/><p>Gringam and the warrior nodded to each other, and then they pushed open the lid of the sarcophagus. The lid was massive, and they thought that it would be equally heavy, but it was much lighter than they expected. The two of them put their backs into pushing it and nearly lost their balance.</p><br/><p>After pushing open the sarcophagus lid, the contents reflected the light and emitted a blinding, sparkling radiance.</p><br/><p>There were ornaments and jewellery of gold and silver and various gemstones. There were over a hundred gold coins within the sarcophagus at a glance.</p><br/><p>While he had expected something like this when they saw the flag, Gringam could not help but break into a smile as he saw all this. The thief carefully examined the interior, then reached into the sarcophagus and took out a piece of gleaming treasure \u2014 a gold necklace.</p><br/><p>It was a breathtakingly beautiful marvel of craftsmanship. At a glance, the gold necklace looked like an ordinary necklace, but the chains were each carved with exquisite inscriptions.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026It\u2019s worth at least a hundred gold coins. You\u2019d be able to get 150 for it no problem, no matter where you sold it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone reacted differently when they heard the results of the thief\u2019s appraisal. Some of them whistled, some smiled so widely they could not close their mouths. What they all had in common was that their eyes were filled with the flames of delight and desire.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe already arranged to get half of this, so at the very least, we\u2019ve already made 50 coins. 10 per person. What a score!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like\u2026 these ruins might end up being a treasure trove after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMarvellous! This is just amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly, but leaving all that treasure here is too much of a waste. We should make good use of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, the wizard reached into the pile of treasure and took out a ring socketed with a massive ruby, which he kissed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s huge.\u201d</p><br/><p>The priest reached into the sarcophagus and pulled back a fistful of gold coins, which he slowly let slip between his fingers.</p><br/><p>The coins clinked against each other with a clear, crisp sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never seen gold coins like these before. Which era and which country did they come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>The thief nicked one of the coins with a knife, and said in a voice filled with emotion:</p><br/><p>\u201cThese gold coins are really high quality. They\u2019re twice the weight of the standard trading coin, and you could probably get even more just from their artistic value alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis really is\u2026 ku\u2026 kukuku\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The group could not control themselves and broke into quiet laughter. Just their share of this treasure alone would be a startling sum.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou lot, thank the gods for your good fortune later. Let us take this treasure with us and discover the true trove. If we tarry, we shall not have a share of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014Alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gringam\u2019s words were met with boisterous approval. Their voices were filled with excitement and passion.</p><br/><p>Part 4</p><br/><p>They were at the central mausoleum. It was surrounded by statues of gigantic warriors and knights which looked like they were protecting their liege lord. They were so realistic that they looked like they might move at any moment. Hekkeran was hidden by the foot of one of the warrior statues, keeping a close eye on one of the four smaller mausoleums.</p><br/><p>After some time, Hekkeran noticed five people running over at top speed from one of the mausoleums. He continued hiding, inspecting the running people for any abnormalities, and also whether anyone was observing them. After that, once he had confirmed that the running people were fine, Hekkeran finally breathed a quiet sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>He leaned out from behind the statue and flashed a signal. Gringam \u2014 who was running at the head of his group \u2014 noticed it and ran toward Hekkeran.</p><br/><p>\u201cGringam, what took you so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy sincerest apologies; it seems I have kept thee waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like we arranged a meeting time, so it\u2019s fine. That aside, let\u2019s move to a different place and decide what we\u2019ll do next.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran lowered his stance, leading the way even as he kept an eye on his surroundings.</p><br/><p>Shortly after they began moving, Gringam asked:</p><br/><p>\u201cA question, if I might; has thy team discovered treasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing the barely-concealed excitement in Gringam\u2019s voice, Hekkeran recalled the way his own team had been, and smiled to him in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yes, we did. We were all smiles. The old man said so too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that was thy experience as well? Truly, we did well by coming to this tomb.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, we should properly thank whichever big shot was buried here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. That said, after discovering so much treasure, we might have to prepare ourselves for the possibility that the main tomb will be barren.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m willing to bet that there\u2019ll be more treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThy words\u2026 how much dare you wager?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad. Not only can I find more in the tomb, but I can make a tidy sum off you as well, wonderful. However, the problem is that you and I might bet on the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither of them laughed out loud, simply smiled broadly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndubitably. Speaking of which, this one has a question to ask of thee; what is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Gringam\u2019s eyes was a massive statue, which had something which looked like a lonely stone plaque by its feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran told the results of their investigations as they continued walking. The other three teams had seen the characters on the slab, but nobody understood it. He had the faint hope that Gringam might be able to make sense of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems to be a stone plaque with symbols that look like language inscribed on it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThou say\u2019st the word \u2018like\u2019 in a vague sense\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody understands that language. It\u2019s not from the Kingdom or the Empire\u2019s language, and neither does it seem to be any of the old languages from around here. It might not even be a human language. However, we did understand the number 2.0.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA number? Logically speaking, that ought to be the date when the mausoleum was built. But in that case, it would be far too small a number.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArche said it might be a riddle linked to these ruins\u2026 ah, in any case, just keep it in mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, I shall certainly do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>After passing the huge statue, they ascended a long, gently sloping flight of stairs that seemed to be made of the same material as the stone sarcophagus, and the entrance to the central mausoleum stretched before them.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Tis the stench of the dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s a common smell on the Katze Plains.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hekkeran expressed his agreement with Gringam\u2019s muttering.</p><br/><p>While it was not as nauseating as the vile odour of decay, the faint stench of undeath unique to graveyards hung in the cold air.</p><br/><p>There were undead present in such a well-kept tomb</p><br/><p>The group prepared themselves as they stepped into the mausoleum. Before them was a great hall. Countless mortuary slabs of stone lined either side of the hall, and opposite them was a staircase leading down. The door leading downstairs was wide open. A strangely chilling gust of ice-cold air flowed out from behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Led by Hekkeran, Gringam\u2019s group descended the stairs.</p><br/><p>A burial vault lay at the foot of the stairs, with a set of doors straight ahead. It seemed to be the only one around.</p><br/><p>While it was more cramped than the room above \u2014 the mausoleum \u2014 it was wide enough. Hekkeran\u2019s companions in Foresight, Eruya\u2019s Tenbu and Palpatra\u2019s group were all here.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, what shall we do next? The original plan was to split up here and investigate the interior, but after inspecting the mausoleums, do you have any other ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying so, Hekkeran looked around at everyone else.</p><br/><p>It did not feel like anyone wanted to propose anything new. Was it desire, or just a simple trick of the light? He could not be sure what that glow in everyone\u2019s eyes was. Their faces were filled with excitement as they longed to rush into the depths of the tomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I have a suggestion. We\u2019ll sweep the outside in a circle to check for hidden doors.\u201d</p><br/><p>The team leader might have spoken, but the team members did not look happy at it.</p><br/><p>After all, they had all seen the glittering prizes just now. Even if that opinion came from their veteran leader, it was very hard for them to go along with it. Surely, they must have imagined the treasure fleeing before their very eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about it? We\u2019ve checked the surface, but we can\u2019t say we checked it very thoroughly. There might be other routes hidden beneath the mausoleums, don\u2019t you think? Besides, we haven\u2019t checked the graveyard, have we?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe what the revered elder is trying to say is that according to the songs of the bards about the great ruins \u2014 that is to say, the Ruins of Sasashal \u2014 there was a safe passage near the entrance which could take everyone straight to the heart of the area.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Gringam. We\u2019ve checked already, but unfortunately there aren\u2019t any secret doors in this room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely. We\u2019re willing to take one for the team, so in exchange, we hope you\u2019ll give us a share of the treasures you find on this level. How about 10% from each other team? Also, if you find another level below, can we ask for the right to go in and look first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no objections to that proposal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first to reply was Gringam. Shortly after that, Hekkeran also expressed his agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it seems nobody objects! By the way, how about you, Uzruth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPersonally, I object very much, but it\u2019s only 10%, hardly a big deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man laughed merrily at Eruya\u2019s barbed reply. It was Eruya who was displeased by having his acidic words completely disregarded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, old sir. In that case, we have a request for you. We found a huge flag woven of precious metal threads in the mausoleum we investigated. We didn\u2019t bring it along because it was too bulky. Can we trouble you to help us bring it back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI concur with Hekkeran\u2019s opinion. Though it shames me to trouble thee, I would be glad if thou couldst help us recover ours as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s that way, we\u2019ll leave ours to you as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eruya jerked his chin at one of the Elves, and the skinny girl shakily unloaded a large piece of cloth she was carrying on her back and laid it on the ground</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Is there anything else you wish to leave behind, or which you want us to take away?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nobody answered Palpatra\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Then, we\u2019ll follow the suggestion just now and investigate the surface. You lot need to be careful too. However, if you find any valuables, feel free to leave them for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, revered elder. Gladly will we leave the monsters to thee, but regretfully, we will not leave so much as a single coin of treasure behind.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group chuckled, and then Hekkeran asked everyone: \u201cThen, shall we move out?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group accepted that suggestion immediately, and so they went forth. Their eyes gleamed with desire and expectation as they took their first step into the unknown ruins \u2014 the underground tomb.</p><br/><p>After opening the door in the room, a passage led straight into the depths. Perhaps they should have expected this, but the passage was very clean.</p><br/><p>This was a passage of stone with no mildew or algae growing on it. There were alcoves on either side, each filled with human-sized objects wrapped in funerary shrouds. There was none of the stench that was unique to corpses. There was just the cold, clear air, as well as a smell like that of the dead.</p><br/><p>There were white lights spaced along the ceiling at regular intervals, but due to the great distance between them, there were still a lot of shadowy corners along the passage. While it did not affect their travels, the dimly-lit lamplight made them wonder if they had missed something. Moving without preparing illumination seemed quite dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cRober, is there an undead reaction from that body?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, none at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Arche replied, and then walked over to a wrapped corpse, slicing the shroud open with a dagger. After seeing her actions, two of the men from the group stepped forward to help expose the cadaver underneath the shrouds.</p><br/><p>\u201cJudging by the height and physique, it\u2019s most likely human. And a grown male.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s not wearing clothes, so we can\u2019t tell which era the ruins came from.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill, these ruins really are a mystery. We can\u2019t tell its age from its architecture or the burial styles. For all we know, these ruins might be from over 600 years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014If that were really the case, then this would be a historic find.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps that topic might have been interesting to an academic, but they were here to work.</p><br/><p>As Hekkeran and Gringam stared icily at them, the three quickly added: \u201cThese ruins\u2019 date of construction and background are still a mystery, after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. Can we move on now? I want to kill monsters.\u201d</p><br/><p>The somewhat displeased Eruya expressed his agreement with Hekkeran and Gringam, and the group continued forward again. However, they stopped again after taking a few steps.</p><br/><p>Everyone drew their weapons, steeling themselves for combat.</p><br/><p>The sound of bones rattling came from ahead of them.</p><br/><p>They could see undead creatures running at them from ahead under the illumination of the ceiling lights.</p><br/><p>As the distance between them shrank and they saw what they were up against, a commotion rose from the shocked Workers, as though they had seen something they did not dare believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh come on, are you kidding me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOi, oi, seriously\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Are those really Skeletons?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment someone mentioned the names of those monsters, their laughter exploded forth uncontrollably to fill the entire passageway.</p><br/><p>\u201cOi oi oi oi! No matter how you look at it, Skeletons just won\u2019t be enough, right? There\u2019s all of us over here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Skeleton-type monsters did not vary too much in appearance, and sometimes, one might not be able to tell them apart at a glance.</p><br/><p>However, judging by the impression they gave, the Workers were certain that these were just ordinary Skeletons.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is supposed to be a recon in force, then they ought to be sending stronger monsters \u2014 I\u2019ve got it! Either nobody\u2019s in charge of these ruins, or the opposition can\u2019t gauge our strength, or they\u2019re stupid enough that they haven\u2019t discovered the intruders yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s laughter continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, Skeletons are just too far-fetched. For all we know, the treasures of these ruins are only in the mausoleums above.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Skeletons were far too weak in comparison to these Workers, who were comparable to mithril-ranked adventurers. In addition, they were fewer in number than the Workers, so they had no idea what the opposition was thinking.</p><br/><p>Faced with the six Skeletons blocking their path, everyone looked at each other, not knowing who should go first.</p><br/><p>\u201cCount me out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eruya clearly stated his opinion, and everyone could understand how he felt.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I shall go.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Gringam strode forward.</p><br/><p>There was no telling what was going through the Skeletons\u2019 empty heads. Did they think the lone warrior had been cast out of his group? Or something else?</p><br/><p>The Skeletons attacked at once, and then\u2014</p><br/><p>His cleaving axe and shield easily smashed them to bits.</p><br/><p>It had only taken the space of a few seconds. No, in fact it had been even less than that.</p><br/><p>After shattering the six Skeletons and treading their remains underfoot, Gringam sighed tiredly. It was nto because he had been fatigued by battle, but because he was very disappointed by the fact that after coming to these unexplored ruins which were a Worker\u2019s dream, the very first battle which was supposed to add color and flavor to this adventure had turned out to be against Skeletons, the lowest-ranking of the undead. He found it quite sad.</p><br/><p>\u201cPathetic, Skeletons are just Skeletons, after all. That said, don\u2019t get careless. Consider that more powerful undead might show up, and advance while staying alert!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s lips drew tight as they heard Gringam\u2019s words. They advanced, deeper into the ruins, their hearts filled with expectation for the mountain of treasure that awaited them.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cGood grief, they\u2019re gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all gone. They might be Workers, but we did break bread with them, and they\u2019re our comrades for this job. I hope they\u2019ll come back safely\u2026 what do you think, Momon-san?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2014That they\u2019re all going to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz answered in gloomy tones, and the leader of the adventurers who had questioned him froze up.</p><br/><p>Crap. I said what was in my heart\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEr, no, what I meant was that we should be mentally prepared for that outcome. These are previously undiscovered, and there\u2019s no telling what dangers are waiting for them inside. Being too optimistic is harmful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see, so that\u2019s what you meant\u2026 thanks for your concern.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026I thought I was being pretty stiff, did that actually pass muster? I feel pretty good about this.</p><br/><p>The leader was probably nodding non-stop because those words were spoken by an adamantite-ranked man, so he was blindly thinking the best of him.</p><br/><p>It would seem that Ainz\u2019s efforts \u2014 he had been as friendly and approachable as possible during their journey to Nazarick \u2014 had borne fruit, given their favorable attitude towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, in keeping with the plan, I will go rest first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz headed for his \u2014 naturally, he shared it with Narberal \u2014 tent. Since it was some distance away from the other tents, he knew some people had been spreading rumors that it was because he did not want certain\u2026 sounds to be heard by others. In fact,, the adventurers\u2019 leader had told him that just now.</p><br/><p>Compared to the Workers, the leader seemed to want to become closer to Momon, who was a fellow adventurer, which was why he had told him what he had heard from the Workers.</p><br/><p>Ainz and Narberal entered the tent together and closed the flap, and then just in case, they checked around outside. Nobody seemed to be paying attention to them; in fact, they seemed to be deliberately trying not to stare at Ainz.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026While people call this a love nest, I guess I was right to not deny it right away. That way, they won\u2019t be suspicious of why we pitched our tent so far away, and they won\u2019t pay undue attention to us or come near this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>He might have lost some things, but he had gained much more in return.</p><br/><p>Ainz took off his helmet, exposing his skeletal face.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow then, Nabe\u2026 no, Narberal, I will be returning to Nazarick. I plan to have Pandora\u2019s Actor take my place; if anything happens before that, think of a clever way to deal with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood, Ainz-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMm. If anything happens, contact me immediately. I\u2019ll leave that to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz dismissed his magically-created armor and swords. The weight of the helmet in his hands vanished as well.</p><br/><p>He did not feel tired, but after being liberated from the full-body bindings of his armor, he could not help but sigh contentedly. He rotated his shoulders \u2014 which did not ache \u2014 as a remnant of his human personality.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Good grief.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt that the lingering shreds of his human feelings were an impediment to him.</p><br/><p>If he could calmly deal with all his problems, perhaps his present circumstances would be different. But if he did not have the remnants of his humanity with him, would he still cherish the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick? Perhaps his thoughts as the human being Suzuki Satoru and his fond memories of his friends would have vanished with it.</p><br/><p>Ainz smiled bitterly as he cast a spell. There was no part of his mind that still pondered the question of his humanity. Ainz was not a great enough person to worry about two or three problems at the same time and what he should do about them. He ought to be focusing on the task at hand and discarding everything else.</p><br/><p>The spell he cast was [Greater Teleportation]</p><br/><p>Because he was wearing the Ring, Ainz bypassed the barrier deployed over Nazarick and arrived immediately at the chamber before the Throne Room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome home, Ainz-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after that, a melodious female voice greeted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve returned, Albedo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The deeply-bowed woman raised her head, and a smile like a flower blooming spread across her ravishing features.</p><br/><p>Uhhhh\u2026</p><br/><p>As he saw the look of loving adoration in her eyes, Ainz felt itchy all over and he wanted to roll around on the ground. However, he could not act in a way which did not fit Ainz Ooal Gown, sovereign of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick.</p><br/><p>In order to suppress the weak, lingering emotions within himself, Ainz deliberately coughed, something that his skeletal body should not have required.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf all is proceeding according to plan, the invaders should be coming soon. No, perhaps they have already arrived. Have the welcome preparations been made?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are flawless. I am certain we will be able to entertain our guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026 Albedo, I look forward to the reception you have prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz entered the heart of Nazarick; the Throne Room. Albedo was a step behind him, but soon caught up.</p><br/><p>Ainz had given Albedo an order concerning the intruders this time round. He had expressed the desire to observe the performance of the defenses she had erected under live battle conditions.</p><br/><p>In the past, his friends had decided where the POP monsters would spawn in Nazarick and where to station the monsters. His friends\u2019 arrangements were flawless. But now that the situation had changed, there was no guarantee that there might not be a better way.</p><br/><p>In that case, one could say that re-evaluating the security arrangements was a pressing necessity. Therefore, he wanted to take this opportunity to observe it for himself.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026The intruders are very weak, so obviously it will be impossible to use them to verify all the systems. Still, I hope we will learn something from this operation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood. I guarantee I will meet your expectations, Ainz-sama.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery good. Also, as you know, spraying poison gas on the enemy before the undead charge them and other currency-utilizing traps are to be strenuously avoided. I hope you will stick to traps that involve the POP monsters. Will that be alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz nodded as he saw Albedo\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally now? Then I shall stay here and enjoy the show. Right, where are the other Floor Guardians?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI ordered everyone to gather upon your return. They will enter as they arrive. Is that acceptable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall allow it. After all, it is more amusing when more people are gathered.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ainz slowly sat down upon the throne, several television monitor-like objects appeared before him. The monitors showed scenes from within Nazarick; or in other words, the scenes which their controller Albedo wanted Ainz to see.</p><br/><p>This should have been the result of Albedo\u2019s tinkering with the defense network, but Ainz was not quite sure what had been changed.</p><br/><p>\u2026In order for this training exercise to be fruitful, I need to learn something from these images. Otherwise, things will go badly when the exercise is concluded and we swap opinions.</p><br/><p>Ainz was the supreme ruler of Nazarick. Such a highly-placed man could not claim ignorance of the defensive systems to his own subordinates.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, just in case, I\u2019d like to confirm that Ariadne won\u2019t activate, will it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened the control console and saw that all was well, but he still could not help asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so. However, I have a question for you, Ainz-sama. If the intruders block up the entrance, will Ariadne activate?</p><br/><p>Ainz recalled Q&amp;As he had seen before in YGGDRASIL. Or no, had it been explained in a patch?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t think so\u2026 I remember it shouldn\u2019t\u2026 I think.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had been that way in YGGDRASIL, but nobody could guarantee that it would still be that way in this world. Besides, they could not be sure if the Ariadne system even existed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what if there was some sort of man-made manipulation? What would happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might not activate, but after thinking about the losses we\u2019ll take if it does, I\u2019d rather not take that risk.</p><br/><p>The Ariadne system.</p><br/><p>This was one of the checking mechanisms involved in the YGGDRASIL base creation system.</p><br/><p>The simplest way to make an impregnable fortress was to simply block up all the entrances so nobody could get in. For a large underground tomb like Nazarick, simply burying it underground would suffice. However, that was intolerable from a gameplay perspective.</p><br/><p>The Ariadne system was used to monitor them in order to keep players from building a base like that, which was difficult to invade.</p><br/><p>The system specifications required that there be a continuous path from the entrance to the heart of the dungeon. That aside, the Ariadne system would also measure the distance travelled within the dungeon, the number of doors one had to pass through, and many other categories, all in exacting detail.</p><br/><p>Once a dungeon which violated these requirements was uploaded to YGGDRASIL, a penalty would be levied and a great deal of funds would be deducted from the guild coffers.</p><br/><p>For Nazarick, the 5th and 6th Floors had solved all these problems \u2014 that, and the help of a great deal of cash items had helped them sustain such a large dungeon.</p><br/><p>One of the monitors which Ainz was controlling showed an image of the Workers.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh! Alright, they\u2019ve finally entered.

By process of elimination, it has to be them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ainz shifted the monitor so Albedo could see, and pointed to a group of people.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
