Regardless of whether you truly care for Xuanxuan, you have taken care of her for a very long time. So today, I let you go. Whether or not you can escape the Dark Temple\u2019s pursuit will depend on your luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying these words, Leng Lingyun turned around and followed behind Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>Liu Xue Jing stood there in a daze as she stared at Leng Lingyun\u2019s back. Her heart felt as painful as if it was stabbed by a knife. It\u2019s all over. It turned out that from the beginning to the end, this man who made her crazy never had her in his heart! Never.</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing didn\u2019t even look at the Pope, who was already dead, and hurriedly chased after him. A strange smile suddenly appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cClaire! Go to hell!\u201d Liu Xueqing shouted and rushed up.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun, who was at the back, suddenly turned around and cast a light magic without any hesitation. The blinding white light penetrated Liu Xueqing\u2019s body. To his surprise, she didn\u2019t use a weapon or any magic! In other words, she didn\u2019t intend to fight back?</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang gently turned her head around and saw the bitter but satisfied smile on Liu Xueqing\u2019s face. She slightly frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d \u201cQi Aoshuang said lightly. She called back the thoughts of everyone behind her, leaving only Leng Lingyun behind. Liu Xueqing was not a noble saint at this moment, nor was she a hateful woman who was jealous. However, she was a pitiful woman who yearned for her love but could never obtain it.</p><br/><p>Blood started to gush out from Liu Xueqing\u2019s mouth. She couldn\u2019t stop bleeding. A bloody hole in her chest dyed her dress red. She laid on the ground and looked dazedly at Leng Lingyun.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun squatted down, and looked at Liu Xueqing quietly. There were no ripples in her eyes. He asked calmly, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xueqing forced a smile on her face and said with difficulty, \u201cI \u2026 I just want you to remember me. I only want to die in your hands \u2026\u201d Liu Xueqing\u2019s eyes were filled with sadness. Even though she knew it that he could attack her without any hesitation, she still felt great pain in her heart after it happened. Then, at this last moment, let him remember herself. Even if it\u2019s just for a short while \u2026</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun looked at Liu Xueqing silently. Time seemed to come to a standstill.</p><br/><p>After a long while, Leng Lingyun slowly reached out his hand and gently closed Liu Xueqing\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Leng Lingyun withdrew his hand, turned his head, got up, and looked ahead, a bitter smile on his face. Ao Shuang, if I leave, would you remember me?</p><br/><p>Standing outside the Radiant Temple, Qi Aoshuang looked up into the sky and took a deep breath. She slowly closed her eyes before opening them and slowly walked over. The road that she had once been very familiar with.</p><br/><p>Hill Mansion.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, nobody was there. But everything was very neat and tidy, unlike the other mansions that were in a sorry state.</p><br/><p>There was a familiar figure standing at the entrance.</p><br/><p>His golden hair fluttered in the wind, and the green eyes were cold and resolute.</p><br/><p>Rasiah.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you for a long time!\u201d She raised her head and looked at Qi Aoshuang as she said coldly.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang raised her hand to stop the person behind her who was about to make a move. Jean and the others retreated. They understood that this was Aoshuang\u2019s own matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are no match for me.\u201d Qi Aoshuang said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see!\u201d Rasiah furrowed her brows and started to condense magic elements in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder!\u201d With a charming shout, a bolt of lightning condensed in her hands, chopping towards Qi Aoshuang. However, the lightning only stopped in front of Qi Aoshuang, causing a ripple to disappear. It was as if the rain had hit the surface of a lake. Qi Aoshuang only formed a transparent barrier, but she did not take the initiative to attack\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThunder Lightning Flash!\u201d Rasiah stood still, her eyes shining, her hands flying in the air as she quickly chanted an incantation.</p><br/><p>Thick thunder and lightning descended from the top of Qi Aoshuang\u2019s head, but it was still the same as before. They rippled a little before vanishing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve improved a lot.\u201d Qi Aoshuang said softly.</p><br/><p>Rasiah bit her lips, put her hands together in front of her chest and chanted a complicated incantation. Following which, dense lightning appeared on Qi Aoshuang\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Aoshuang didn\u2019t raise her head. She only looked at Rasiah, who was still trying to hit her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThunderstorm!\u201d Rasiah\u2019s eyes were wide open in fury as she unleashed her most powerful spell.</p><br/><p>A rumbling sound rang out, but the seemingly powerful lightning strikes just disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I said, you are no match for me.\u201d Qi Aoshuang walked away. The person she was looking for was not her, but the one whose hands were stained with her mother\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Rasiah stretched out her hands to block the path in front of Qi Aoshuang, her eyes filled with stubbornness.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang slowly lowered her head to look at the stubborn young girl in front of her. Suddenly, she stretched out her hand and gently caressed Rasiah\u2019s head. Her face revealed a slight smile, \u201cYou have grown taller.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rasiah tightly pursed her lips, but her tears flowed uncontrollably. Finally, she cried out, extending her arms to hug Qi Aoshuang, \u201cWhy? Why didn\u2019t you take me with you? Why did you leave me? Why did you have to leave? \u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang sighed softly, but she did not say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. I know I didn\u2019t stand up. But I\u2019ve been regretting it. Sister! Wu wu wu wu \u2026 I miss you! I miss you!\u201d Rasiah hugged Qi Aoshuang tightly, refusing to let go.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang rubbed Rasiah\u2019s hair, smiling faintly as she said, \u201cEn, I understand.\u201d \u201d</p><br/><p>Rasiah cried until she was out of breath and refused to let go of her hand.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang did not move.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have dismissed the servants, the Hill Mansion is empty now. My father had long since disappeared. My big brother had disappeared as well. There\u2019s nothing left in this house. \u201d After a while, Rasiah regained her senses, wiped her tears and said to Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d She only said one word. She walked inside because she could feel that the person did not leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, wait here.\u201d Qi Aoshuang did not turn her head around, only lightly throwing out those words. Everyone stopped walking. Rasiah wanted to follow, but she was stopped by Jean. Rasiah frowned and looked back at Jean\u2019s ice-cold face. He shook his head slightly.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang slowly walked into the room she was most familiar with. It was here that her fifteenth birthday took place in this grand and spacious hall. After passing through the corridor, Qi Aoshuang looked towards the greenhouse on the right and the training field far away. There were indelible memories. She used to drink tea in the greenhouse. The sudden appearance of White Emperor in a few training grounds as well as her arduous battle with Jean. The formerly glorious Hill Mansion now was deathly silent.</p><br/><p>There were no more Catherine\u2019s warm laughter here.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang slowly walked to her own bedroom and gently opened the door, staring at the bed in a daze. The first thing she saw when she opened her eyes was Catherine\u2019s worried face. It was here that she experienced the first rays of the sun.</p><br/><p>It was like a lifetime had passed, but it was also like yesterday.</p><br/><p>Aushuang closed the door gently, turned around and walked towards the study room.</p><br/><p>Pushing open the door of the study, she saw the rose emblem on the wall.</p><br/><p>The flag of the rose will always fly, the Hill family will always remain.</p><br/><p>The old oath was still there, and now it was gone.</p><br/><p>Perhaps, from that moment on, Gutton knew that she was not the original Claire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou finally came \u2026\u201d An elderly voice suddenly sounded in Qi Aoshuang\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang did not turn her head. This voice belonged to Gutton.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said, I will definitely come back.\u201d Qi Aoshuang laughed coldly, turning around and looking at Gutton who was standing in front of the bookshelf.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve wondered if I was wrong to do that to you. \u201cGutton also looked at Qi Aoshuang and said slowly, \u201cAfter thinking about it many times, I think I was right. There were always sacrifices. Somebody has to pay the price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Aoshuang smiled faintly, showing a trace of ridicule on the corner of her mouth. This person was still stubborn. In his eyes, everything could be sacrificed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, your eternal Hill family no longer exists. Everything has been turned into nothingness. \u201d Qi Aoshuang smiled coldly as she watched the forced calmness of the Gutton\u2019s face slowly distort. The image of Catherine\u2019s tender and pained eyes appeared before her eyes once more. She hated the person in front of her even more, \u201cHaha, the Hill family? What else do you have now? You\u2019re like a lost dog. Not to mention no home, even the owner was gone. What else do you have? \u201d Qi Aoshuang laughed coldly. Finally, she could destroy everything of him!</p><br/><p>Gutton glared, his fists clenched. Suddenly, he let out a loud shout and rushed forward. His entire body burst forth with battle power, and he threw a fierce punch at Qi Aoshuang.</p><br/><p>His fist suddenly enlarged in front of Qi Aoshuang, and the scene of that day suddenly appeared in front of her eyes. This was the fist that struck the back of Catherine. Blood sprayed all over her body. It was this person that killed Catherine that she cared about the most!</p><br/>\n</div>"}
