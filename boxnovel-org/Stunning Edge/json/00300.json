This was the first direct exchange between the two of them since they left the Tian Dao Sect.</p><br/><p>Jonathan looked at Qi Ao Shuang nervously before looking at Dittas. Ever since the return of the Tian Dao Sect, the relationship between the two had dropped to a freezing point. They had not spoken a word, but now that they had met face to face, what would happen?</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang looked coldly at Dentance and asked in a deep voice: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d This was what had originally been Diantz\u2019s main concern. He was concerned about how Qi Ao Shuang was feeling right now. In short, he was still far from breaking through.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will break through before you.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang said without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, very good.\u201d Before me, anyone you have anything to do with doesn\u2019t have to die. But if you break through with me, they\u2019re still going to die. \u201cThe existence of those people will prevent you from advancing any further \u2026\u201d Before he could finish his words, a strong gale instantly arose in the surroundings. The fierce gale blew away everyone\u2019s clothes, and their hair was in disarray.</p><br/><p>And all of this was done with Qi Ao Shuang as the center. Innumerable gusts of wind gushed out from Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s body, filling the surroundings. Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression sank to the bottom, and her eyes became even colder. He just stared at Dittos coldly. A gust of wind instantly cut a bloody wound on Dittas\u2019 handsome face, and blood began to slowly flow out.</p><br/><p>Dotans didn\u2019t move, nor did he move. He just stood there quietly, staring at Xiao Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was extremely stiff, and only the sound of the wind could be heard.</p><br/><p>Jonathan\u2019s palms were moist with sweat. They couldn\u2019t fight like this. Although Xiao Ao Shuang had improved a lot during this period of time, the other party was still a Dentain. He did not want anything to happen to Xiao AoShuang, not even a little bit of damage.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, get stronger.\u201d The wind suddenly stopped after Dittens said those words in a low voice. The surroundings quieted down, and Dittas did not say anything else. He turned around and left alone.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stood still, but her eyes became colder and colder.</p><br/><p>She understood that the battle with this man wouldn\u2019t be too far off.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, Qi Ao Shuang, are you alright?\u201d Jonathan asked nervously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can I do!\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang replied snappily, then walked away with a sullen face.</p><br/><p>Jonathan shivered and hurried after him.</p><br/><p>After some discussion with Brill, Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan came out of the tower again. However, the mysterious man in white clothes did not appear again, causing Qi Ao Shuang to be bewildered. What was that man doing? Why did it never appear again?</p><br/><p>A month flew by.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang sat on the bed with her eyes closed, feeling the strange feeling that had just disappeared. It seemed that the breakthrough wasn\u2019t too far off. Tomorrow, he would go to the Sky Tower and the ninth floor.</p><br/><p>At that moment, there was a sudden knock on the door.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly opened her eyes, filled with doubt. Who could it be?</p><br/><p>Opening the door, he saw Parina\u2019s extremely haggard appearance. Her eyes were bloodshot and dark circles covered them. Her face was pale and a little green. However, her eyes were extremely firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cParina?\u201d What\u2019s wrong? \u201cIf you want to ask about your brother, then don\u2019t worry. Your brother is fine right now.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang did not move aside, but stood in front of the door and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Thank you. \u201cI came here today because I have something that I want to talk to you about.\u201d Parina pursed her lips, seemingly trying to cheer herself up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang asked indifferently. She knew that she could not give the person in front of her a shred of hope, or else, in the end, she would be filled with endless despair.</p><br/><p>\u201cTonight, you must come to the grove by the lake, the place where we first met. \u201cPlease, I have something important to tell you.\u201d Parina looked up and said seriously while biting her somewhat pale lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can\u2019t I say here?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang turned her head slightly, not looking at Parina, and said these words in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot here.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very important matter!\u201d She turned around and quickly ran away. After running a few steps, she turned around and added, \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you there tonight. It\u2019s really important. You have to come!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for any reaction from Qi Ao Shuang, Parina quickly ran away.</p><br/><p>Looking at Parina\u2019s back, Xiao Ao Shuang thought about what happened that made Parina react in such a way. Was it really important? Could this be related to the conspiracy behind the Star Academy? Thinking of this, Xiao Ao Shuang\u2019s face turned solemn. If that was the case, then he really needed to see Parina and ask her what was going on. After pondering for a moment, Xiao Ao Shuang went back and closed the door.</p><br/><p>Of course, what Xiao Ao Shuang didn\u2019t see was that within Dittas\u2019 dorm, Dittas, who was sitting on his bed with his eyes closed and resting, suddenly opened his eyes, a faint sullen look in his eyes.</p><br/><p>That night, Qi Ao Shuang and Jonathan left the cafeteria after dinner. Qi Ao Shuang turned to Jonathan and said, \u201cGo back first, I still have some matters to attend to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Jonathan asked hastily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a small matter, you can go back first.\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang did not say anything more. She left Jonathan and turned around to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, Ao Shuang, Ao Shuang \u2026\u201d Jonathan called out to Qi Ao Shuang, but Qi Ao Shuang ignored him and continued to walk forward. Jonathan stood there for a long time, thinking, and then left.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slowly walked forward and arrived at the quiet little forest. Under the night sky, the forest seemed even quieter, with only the occasional sound of insects. At night, this place was deserted. It was a good place for peace and quiet.</p><br/><p>After sitting down, Qi Ao Shuang waited for Parina to arrive. Pieces of leaves fluttered in the air. Qi Ao Shuang extended her hand and grabbed a leaf, gently stroking it.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, light footsteps came from the forest. Qi Ao Shuang did not move. She could tell that the footsteps belonged to Parina. Sure enough, after a while, Parina appeared in front of Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, you\u2019re here \u2026\u201d I beg of you, you will still come, won\u2019t you? \u201d Parina slowly approached Qi Ao Shuang, a strange light flickering in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want, tell me.\u201d \u201cIs this something related to the Star Academy\u2019s conspiracy?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang frowned slightly, but didn\u2019t reply to Parina. Instead, she coldly asked this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think this is the reason?\u201d A look of disappointment appeared on Parina\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else do you think it is?\u201d \u201cI think I made it clear that it\u2019s absolutely impossible between you and me.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression turned colder and colder. If the reason Parina called him here was just to say these things, then he had really come at the wrong time! Qi Ao Shuang said in a cold voice and was about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Xiao Aushuang, I called you here because I really have something to do. \u201cThere really is a secret behind the Star Academy.\u201d Seeing that Qi Ao Shuang was about to leave, she hurriedly opened her mouth and said those words.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, there was some astonishment on Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s face. She turned to Parina, who had an anxious look on her face, and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a companion beast who heard the argument between the principal and the elder. \u201cThey, they don\u2019t seem to belong to this world. They came to this world to work for a certain person or force.\u201d Parina stared fixedly at Xiao Aushuang and quickly told her what she found out.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyebrows furrowed together as her face grew serious. She slowly walked back to her seat and sat down. Patting the seat beside her, she said to Parina, \u201cSit down and let\u2019s talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d A smile appeared on Parina\u2019s face. She hurriedly went over and sat down, then began to explain the dispute between the headmaster and the elders in the headmaster\u2019s office.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Ao Shuang heard this, her expression became more and more serious. Parina\u2019s news was startling, but when she thought about it carefully, she wasn\u2019t surprised. And the person that the dean spoke of, the person that the elder had released, could it be that mysterious white-clothed man? The white-clothed man was originally their prey, but he was still let go by that elder. At that time, it was likely a world-shaking fight that shook the entire Stellar Tower. Did that man in white know the Dean\u2019s true purpose?</p><br/><p>They did not belong in this world, but in order to return to their original hometown, did they hold a position in the Star Academy? Where was their home? Could it be in another plane? Thinking of this, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s heart sank. The people or powers behind them probably wouldn\u2019t be so simple. The entire chaosworld was being toyed with by that person or force. One could imagine how terrifying that person\u2019s strength was!</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, Qi Ao Shuang?\u201d Parina carefully called out to the absent-minded Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d \u201cOh.\u201d Xiang Ao Shuang came back to his senses, looking at the hopeful look on Parina\u2019s face, he smiled and said, \u201cParina, thank you for this news. It\u2019s very important, and very useful to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as it\u2019s useful to you.\u201d A smile appeared on Parina\u2019s face. Only now did her haggard face brighten a little. One could imagine how miserable her life had been after being completely rejected by Qi Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, thank you.\u201d I will uncover the truth of this as soon as possible. Not to mention your brother. \u201cI\u2019ll go back first.\u201d Xiao Aushuang stood up and was about to leave. She needed some time to properly digest the information that Parina had given her today.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d \u201cQi Ao Shuang!\u201d Just as Qi Ao Shuang stood up to leave, Parina stood up abruptly and threw herself into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cParina!\u201d Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression changed immediately. She reached out her hand, trying to pull Parina out of her embrace. However, Parina used all the strength in her body to tightly hug Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s waist, unwilling to let go no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi Ao Shuang, I like you. I\u2019ve never liked anyone before, and I\u2019ve never been so worried about anyone. I really like you \u2026\u201d Parina\u2019s subsequent desperate confession made Qi Ao Shuang even more upset.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}
