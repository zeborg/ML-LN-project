One thing was certain, this was not the smell of blood. Qi Ao Shuang frowned slightly, this place could not fly. There was a tyrannical restriction in the air that prevented people from flying in this place. Thinking about it, if these places could fly, then the difficulty of the trial would be greatly reduced.</p><br/><p>Behind Qi Ao Shuang, Ashen\u2019s group followed closely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat kid won\u2019t be far.\u201d This was his first time here, so he wasn\u2019t familiar with the terrain. We\u2019ll stop him from the short way. \u201d Ashlin said in a deep voice. There weren\u2019t many people who came in at this time. It made Ashlin feel more at ease. He mustn\u2019t let anyone know that it was them who did it. Otherwise, if the academy were to find out, it would deal with him as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d The others were naturally obedient to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeeds is real, too, cowardly, saying it\u2019s best not to offend this kid. What\u2019s so special about this kid? How could it be as powerful as he claimed? \u201cLet him die without a complete corpse today.\u201d A trace of disdain appeared in Ashlin\u2019s eyes. Now he remembered the warning Leeds had given him the other day.</p><br/><p>Leeds had repeatedly warned him that Qi Ao Shuang was definitely not as simple as she appeared to be. His strength should also be hidden. Better not to offend him. Better to stay away from him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s go to the man-eating vine and wait for him.\u201d \u201cThis kid doesn\u2019t know that place. This time, he\u2019s really dead without a complete corpse.\u201d The others grinned.</p><br/><p>The man-eating vine, as its name suggested, was a kind of carnivorous plant. They are usually in a deep sleep, but they wake up as soon as someone or an animal touches them. After that, there was a large group of attacking living things with poisonous thorns all over their bodies. After piercing the skin, it numbed the human body and then slowly ate it, leaving not even a single bone and muscle behind. \u201cPop, pop, pop, pop, pop .\u201d But as long as humans or animals do not touch them or attack them, they will not act.</p><br/><p>Ashlin and his men had already gotten a good look at the topography of the first level. They quickly cut off the route to the cannibal area in front of them to wait for Xiao Ao Shuang.</p><br/><p>The narrow canyon was the only way to the second level, and only three people could pass through it side by side. On both sides were dark mountains, all of them covered with dark green cannibal vines. If the people in the canyon accidentally touched the cannibal vines, then the cannibal vines in the two mountains would rush over like a tidal wave. A weak person would naturally die without a doubt.</p><br/><p>Although Qi Ao Shuang was the first one to enter the Heavenly Tower, Ashen still ordered one of them to hide in the front of the canyon just in case something went wrong. If the others came first, then he would think of a way to delay them to the side. Most experts would only enter after them. Many of the people who came in first were freshmen, and Ashlin wasn\u2019t afraid that the people he sent out wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with the freshmen.</p><br/><p>Ashlin and the rest of his party had some skill with Earth-type magic. He had created a hidden pit at the edge of the canyon. Everyone was hiding inside and were focusing on the entrance of the canyon. As soon as Qi Ao Shuang appeared, they would throw out their daggers, waking up the closest vine beside Qi Ao Shuang to attack her.</p><br/><p>Ashlin looked at the dark green cannibal vines drifting gently in the wind at both sides of the entrance of the canyon, the corner of his mouth revealing a cruel and proud smile. He seemed to have seen how Qi Ao Shuang was entangled by a large group of man-eating vines and then panicked. When he desperately shouted for help, they appeared at the right time and began to mock him. How straightforward that would be.</p><br/><p>After a long period of time, Qi Ao Shuang still hadn\u2019t appeared. Ashlin frowned and said in a low voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Why hasn\u2019t that stinky brat come yet? \u201cLogically speaking, he should be here by now.\u201d Ashlin deliberately lowered his voice, afraid that he would disturb the man-eating vines around them. Although these man-eating vines did not pose a threat to their lives, if they were to move together, it would be quite troublesome.</p><br/><p>The other people in the pit were also frowning in thought. After so long, the red-haired kid still hadn\u2019t appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that something happened to Ferry?\u201d A person whispered. Ferris was the one Ashlin had sent ahead to intercept the freshmen.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cThat brat doesn\u2019t have that much ability, nor does he have the guts to do so.\u201d Ashlin said disdainfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, but last time \u2026\u201d That person was a bit stumped, but he did not finish his words.</p><br/><p>Ashlin\u2019s expression changed slightly, naturally recalling the two times he had suffered losses at the hands of Qi Ao Shuang. Once was when he was sent flying in front of everyone\u2019s eyes in the cafeteria, and once was when he held onto her from behind the school building. Could it be that this kid really wasn\u2019t as simple as he looked on the surface?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d \u201cWhen he comes, I will definitely tear him into a thousand pieces!\u201d \u201cWait for me to cut off his dazzling red hair and show it to Leeds. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s afraid of!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Ashlin finished this sentence, a mocking voice sounded in their ears, \u201cOh, are you talking about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of Ashlin and the rest changed. This voice belonged to none other than the person they were planning to plot against, Qi Ao Shuang!</p><br/><p>The next moment, he didn\u2019t wait for them to react. Puff! Puff! Puff! Puff! The sound suddenly rang out, followed by the ear-piercing sound of crashing sounds coming from the surroundings of Ashlin\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>The man-eating vines around them were awakened!</p><br/><p>The man-eating vines naturally detected the life in this pit. After waking up, they all extended out crazily and quickly reached into the pit, trying to coil around the people inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d With a shout, Ashlin was the first to run out of the pit. He began to use magic to attack the awakened man-eating vines.</p><br/><p>Everyone was busy dealing with the man-eating vine. Qi Ao Shuang stood leisurely in front of him as she stared at the scene before her. However, the man-eating vine did not attack Qi Ao Shuang at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, when did you get there?\u201d Ashe Lin looked at the leisurely standing Qi Ao Shuang and asked in a shocked voice. He was both surprised and annoyed. When did Qi Aushuang arrive? They did not even notice, they originally wanted to use the man-eating vines to kill Qi Aushuang, but who would have thought that they would actually be fooled by Qi Aushuang instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I\u2019ll tell you?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled lightly, then she stood aside with her hands in front of her, as if she was watching a show.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent.\u201d \u201cAfter we finish here, I will tear your corpse into a thousand pieces and make you wish you were dead!\u201d The spell Ashlin was using was even more ferocious. It was constantly releasing its power, burning down all the man-eating vines that were close to it.</p><br/><p>Ashlin and his men were still people with 6-star strength, and very quickly, they burned down all the man-eating vines that attacked them. The man-eating vine behind them seemed to be afraid of being burned and slowly retreated.</p><br/><p>Oh? Xiao Ao Shuang raised her eyebrows, she did not expect these plants to have a certain intelligence level. Knowing the situation was bad, they all retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d \u201cYou damned little bastard, now it\u2019s your turn!\u201d Ashlin grinned maliciously at the leisurely looking Qi Ao Shuang. In his eyes, Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s expression was as if she did not know whether she was dead or alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, are you determined to kill me?\u201d Xiao Ao Shuang stood there, looking at the crowd with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d It\u2019s useless for you to kneel on the ground and beg for mercy! \u201cYou have humiliated me twice. Today, I will definitely tear your corpse into a thousand pieces to vent the hatred in my heart!\u201d Ashlin sinisterly said, the ruthlessness in his eyes becoming even more obvious.</p><br/><p>The others also sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there really no other way?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang looked at the crowd helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d It\u2019s too late for you to beg for mercy. \u201cYou must die today!\u201d Ashlin sneered, his face extremely sinister. The others also sneered, their eyes shooting out a cruel glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh \u2026\u201d Qi Ao Shuang sighed softly, then she shook her head, stood up straight and shrugged, \u201cAlright, it seems like there is no room for me to turn around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ashlin was about to laugh out loud, but he met Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>The lazy look in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes earlier instantly turned incomparably cold, as though she could pierce through someone. The smile on her face vanished, replaced by a coldness that resembled a ten thousand year old glacier.</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang slightly narrowed her eyes and raised her hand. A few visible gusts of wind shot towards Ashen\u2019s group, trapping them all in a split-second.</p><br/><p>Ashlin and the others all sneered, wanting to use their power to destroy this seemingly weak wind. However, in the next moment, their expressions all changed. This wind rope could not be destroyed! And this wind rope slowly extended many small wind tendrils, tightly binding them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, what did you do?\u201d Ashlin\u2019s face suddenly changed, because he realized that not only were these wind ropes unable to destroy them, they were slowly tightening and tightening. Almost into his skin.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo what you want to do to me.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled charmingly, tilted her head and said carelessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d \u201cYou actually want to kill me?!\u201d Ashlin\u2019s face was pale. He only saw coldness in Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s eyes. This red-haired youth was not joking! He really wanted to kill him!</p><br/><p>The faces of the other people around Ashlin also changed at this moment. They finally realized that they could not break free from this seemingly weak wind rope, and Qi Ao Shuang was really going to kill them!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang stood there lazily with a faint smile on her face. The ropes that were tied to their bodies became tighter and tighter, gradually tearing through their clothes and digging into their skin. Streaks of blood flowed out. Everyone cried out in pain, but their voices could not be heard from the canyon. Only then did everyone feel even more terrified. Qi Ao Shuang had actually set up a barrier beforehand to prevent their voices from spreading out. At first, they didn\u2019t think much of it. They only thought of using the man-eating vines to kill him.</p><br/><p>Fear gradually engulfed everyone\u2019s hearts. The aura of death enveloped them, suffocating them, making them want to shout out loud in fear and flee. But there was nothing they could do. The intense pain from his body and the torment of his spirit almost drove everyone insane. Tears and snot flowed out simultaneously. Everyone was in a sorry state!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, don\u2019t kill me.\u201d He threatened me with you. \u201cI don\u2019t want to either.\u201d A youth beside Ashlin suddenly knelt down towards Qi Aushuang, begging for mercy with a pained expression on his face.</p><br/><p>When the others saw this, they all followed suit and knelt down without the slightest bit of ambition to beg for mercy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ashlin\u2019s body was also covered in blood. Those complicated ropes were deeply embedded in his flesh, and he was in pain as if he wanted to die. He could no longer care about anything else and kneeled down to beg for mercy, \u201cQi Ao Shuang, I beg you, let me go.\u201d I, my sister is the mayor\u2019s wife of Hurricane City, I can give you what you want. It was fine to be rich or to be wealthy! \u201cAs long as you let me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd that had been clamoring to tear Qi Ao Shuang into a thousand pieces was now in a completely ugly state, kneeling and begging for forgiveness.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang slightly raised her eyebrows, looking at Ashlin with interest. The ropes on Ashlin\u2019s body seemed to have loosened a little.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Ashlin thought that he had persuaded her. He hurriedly said: \u201cPower, money, beautiful women, I can give them to you as long as you bypass me today.\u201d After Ashlin said this, he glared viciously at the people kneeling beside him. These bastards actually dared to sell him out just now. He had to get even with these people in the future. Those people were all startled and secretly complained in their hearts as they thought of how to deal with this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHur hur, it sounds pretty good.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang smiled and looked at Ashlin.</p><br/><p>Ashlin was overjoyed, and was about to stand up from the ground. However, at this moment, Xiao Ao Shuang suddenly turned around and said in a low voice, \u201cPower, money, women \u2026\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, I don\u2019t need any of these.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after he finished speaking, Qi Ao Shuang floated away, her figure quickly disappearing from everyone\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other, unable to believe that Qi Ao Shuang would let them go just like that.</p><br/><p>Ashlin was the first to stand up. He looked in the direction that Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s figure disappeared in, then suddenly turned his head to look at the group of people kneeling on the ground in a daze and fiercely said, \u201cI will definitely not let you go. I will make you beg for death \u2026\u201d However, before he could finish his words, he was interrupted by a loud sound.</p><br/><p>Ashlin\u2019s body instantly exploded at this moment, blood and flesh flying everywhere. The blood and limbs that filled the sky left everyone completely stupefied. The next moment, they all followed in Ashlin\u2019s footsteps. They were all killed by the Wind Rope\u2019s explosive body and died to the point that they couldn\u2019t be any more dead.</p><br/><p>Crash! Crack! Crack! The man-eating vines quickly extended and wrapped around all the limbs on the ground, slowly digesting them. And in the depths of the man-eating vine, there was a corpse. It was the corpse of the person Ashlin had sent to watch over.</p><br/><p>There were only a few puddles of bright red blood on the ground, slowly drying up and turning black.</p><br/><p>Dead without a complete corpse! Tens of thousands of pieces! Previously, Ashlin had been so arrogant, but he didn\u2019t think that the current world would report this quickly!</p><br/><p>Qi Ao Shuang continued to walk forward with a calm face, but a cold glint appeared in her eyes.</p><br/><p>For someone like Ashlin, if there was a chance, he would definitely do his best to kill Ashlin. Otherwise, the future troubles would be endless! In the Star Academy, Qi Ao Shuang was unable to make a move, because she could faintly sense that there were people who were extremely powerful in the academy. If he did something out of bounds there, perhaps he would be the next to be killed. But it was different here. Since the other party could use the unspoken rules to kill him, why couldn\u2019t he instead use the unspoken rules to kill them?</p><br/><p>The wind gently blew, dispersing the thick smell of blood in the air. Only the blackened patches of blood on the floor told of the blood murders that had occurred. However, it would only be considered a weak student who would be alerted and attacked by the man-eating vine.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang walked out of this long and narrow valley, looking at the continuous mountain range ahead, slightly narrowing her eyes. He suddenly turned around and shouted in a low voice: \u201cCome out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you actually know that I\u2019m here.\u201d A sweet and innocent voice entered into Qi Ao Shuang\u2019s ears. In the next moment, Parina\u2019s petite and cute body drilled out from the valley behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy have you been following me?\u201d Qi Ao Shuang asked with a cold face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh, what a way.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to be so ruthless when it comes to being gentle and elegant on the surface.\u201d Parina narrowed her eyes, cackled, and said while tilting her head. She had seen all of that earlier, and seeing that Xiao Aushuang was still unmoved, she smacked her lips in annoyance and said: \u201cHowever, I like things like you.\u201d \u201cYou have to be ruthless, otherwise, you will suffer endless troubles in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ao Shuang glanced at Parina, but didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, she turned around and walked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d Wait for me, I\u2019ll come with you. You know, every level is dangerous. Especially after the sixth level, the level there is completely different from here! Parina shouted.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Ao Shuang heard this, she understood clearly in her heart that this woman was not ordinary, her strength was not only at the two star level. However, the method she used to end up in a two star exam was somewhat intriguing. She must have a way out of this.</p><br/><p>However, even so, Qi Ao Shuang was unwilling to go along with this woman. Her intuition told her that getting involved with this woman was equivalent to getting involved in trouble. Therefore, he didn\u2019t pay attention to her and just strode forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t come with me, aren\u2019t you afraid that I will tell you what happened just now?\u201d Parina threatened.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t.\u201d Qi Ao Shuang threw out a few more words, but didn\u2019t say anything else.</p><br/><p>Parina was stunned for a moment before a smile appeared on her face. Seeing how Qi Ao Shuang was moving faster and faster, Parina grew anxious. \u201cHey, Qi Ao Shuang, why did you leave such a delicate and weak girl like me here alone?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you want to protect me and bring me with you?\u201d Parina shouted angrily from behind him. Seeing that his words from before didn\u2019t work, Zhang Xuan immediately switched to that line of thought. It was indeed hilarious.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Ao Shuang did not stop. On the contrary, she walked faster and faster, and soon, her figure disappeared from Parina\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned kid!\u201d Parina tried to catch up, but she couldn\u2019t. He stomped his feet and cursed in a low voice, \u201cSuch a blockhead who doesn\u2019t know how to care for women.\u201d And then she started laughing herself after swearing. Pity the fairer sex? This damn brat, he didn\u2019t seem to show mercy the first time they met. He directly grabbed onto his collar and handed him over to those smelly girls, how could he expect him to suddenly change his personality?</p><br/><p>Parina grunted and hurried off.</p><br/><p>By this time, both Tarina and Una had reached the narrow canyon. Because of the consolation she felt from Qi Ao Shuang, she quickly dragged Yuna into the Heavenly Tower.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, Tanina. My senior brother told me that the man-eating vines here are very difficult to deal with. They\u2019re all sleeping, so we have to be careful not to wake them up.\u201d Yunia said in a low voice, with a serious expression on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Tarina nodded gently. There weren\u2019t many people ahead of them. If they walked any faster, they should be able to run into Qi Ao Shuang. Thinking up to here, she couldn\u2019t help but frown slightly, worry on her face. I wonder what is going on with Qi Ao Shuang? Just now, Ashlin\u2019s group had hurriedly entered the Heavenly Tower, hoping that they would not cause trouble for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTarina, are you worried about your red-haired junior apprentice-brother?\u201d Eunia suddenly asked in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Hearing what he said, Tarina was startled. After that, he nodded honestly, \u201cHmm, he came in alone, I was afraid that he would be troubled by Ashlin\u2019s group.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eunia was silent for a moment. Ashlin\u2019s group, she had asked about later. They were vindictive and merciless. If the red-haired youth were to meet them alone, he really wouldn\u2019t be optimistic.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d \u201cLook!\u201d Suddenly, Tanina let out a low shout, and her face changed dramatically.</p><br/><p>Una followed her gaze and saw a few patches of dried black blood on the floor. It seems that someone has suffered greatly here.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be him?\u201d Could he have been\u2026? \u201cNo, maybe he\u2019s just hurt!\u201d Her body swaying a little, she tried her best to calm herself down. She stared fixedly at the puddles of blood on the ground, desperately trying to convince herself. Perhaps, Xiao Ao Shuang was only injured. However, the puddles of blood on the ground seemed to be way too big, and it was obvious that they were not simply injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cTarina, calm down, that might not be him!\u201d \u201cCare makes no sense. Have you forgotten that he has some skill?\u201d Eunia whispered.</p><br/><p>Only now did she come back to her senses. Staring at the bloodstains, she murmured, \u201cRight, right, he won\u2019t. He\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s move on.\u201d Yunia sighed softly. She understood that she had only just made a friend that she was quite acquainted with. She was afraid that she had taken a fancy to that red-haired kid. However, he hadn\u2019t noticed it yet.</p><br/><p>By this time, Qi Ao Shuang had already arrived at the entrance to the second level. Along the way, he met a few berserk beasts that were easily taken care of by Qi Ao Shuang. Overall, the first level wasn\u2019t that difficult. As long as one was careful, there wouldn\u2019t be any problems. At the entrance to the second level was a gate glowing with white light. Xiao Ao Shuang did not hesitate, directly burrowing in.</p><br/><p>What was imprinted in front of Qi Ao Shuang was a boundless prairie. The grass, which was half the height of a human, moved with the wind and gave off an indescribable refreshing feeling.</p><br/><p>However, Qi Ao Shuang knew that in this seemingly peaceful grassland, there were many hidden dangers. If he wasn\u2019t careful, he would be beyond redemption.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
