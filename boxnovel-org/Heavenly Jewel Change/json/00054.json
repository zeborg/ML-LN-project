(1)</b></p><br/><p>Cai Cai said coldly: \u201cIndeed, a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll design can be said to be priceless. However, it is still just a design. As a Consolidating Equipment Master yourself, you should be clear that having a design is one thing, and actually creating it is another matter. Do you mean to tell me you have the ability to create this Scroll? Do not joke with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shook his head and said: \u201cOf course not, I definitely do not have the ability currently. However, Principal, I do want to tell you two things.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst of all... in the near future, I have a hundred percent confidence of being able to create this God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scrolls. Do not ask me why, as that is my own personal secret, and I\u2019m sure you aren\u2019t willing to bet. Secondly, although I am currently unable to create the scrolls, that doesn\u2019t mean my teacher isn\u2019t able to. Oh right, I forgot, there is a third thing. I forgot to mention that the design in your hands is just the first of a set. As for this set\u2026 in the Consolidating Equipment Master world, there is something that everyone has heard of but no one has witnessed personally - Legendary Consolidating Equipment Set.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Cai Cai finally lost her cool, standing up suddenly and staring at Zhou Weiqing. Her eyes seemed to glitter as she stared at him, an intense pressure emitting forth from her body.</p><br/><p>A thick aura of Heavenly Energy seemed to surround him. Although it did not seem as irresistible as Ming Wu\u2019s, Zhou Weiqing could still clearly feel that her cultivation level was way above his own.</p><br/><p>Seeing her stand up, Zhou Weiqing sat back down coolly instead, his fingers drumming lightly on the arms of the chair as he smiled faintly and said: \u201cI am just telling advising you, Principal, that you shouldn\u2019t let the Fei Li Empire treat a possible God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master as an enemy\u2026 especially one who has a Legendary Consolidating Equipment Set. Such a scenario, I\u2019m afraid you might not be able to take responsibility. Furthermore, in this world, a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master will never be alone. I think you know what I mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Zhou Weiqing, Cai Cai\u2019s expression was rather ugly as her eyes glittered, staring at him. She had never expected that this little fellow from the Heavenly Bow Empire would actually be able to take out a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Scroll Design, and even proclaiming that it was part of a Legendary Set! Naturally, she knew what that entailed, and if what Zhou Weiqing said was true, when he grew to his full power, he could possibly bring irreparable damage to the Fei Li Empire just through his power alone. Furthermore, just like he said, a God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master was not alone\u2026 and even worse, for his teacher to be able to bring up someone like Zhou Weiqing, and to even give him a Legendary Consolidating Equipment Set Design, it was definitely someone with much status and power, perhaps even a group or family! In such a time when Consolidating Equipment Scrolls were in short supply, it would be literally suicide for the Empire to offend such high level Consolidating Equipment Masters. To do so for just Zhou Weiqing, Cai Cai was definitely not about to do that.</p><br/><p>However, in the next few moments, Cai Cai calmed down, taking her seat once more and giving a cold laugh. Throwing the design back to Zhou Weiqing, she said coldly: \u201cAre you trying to throw me off with just a piece of paper? If this is just something that you or your teacher picked up somewhere by luck, wouldn\u2019t that make me a laughing stock?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing thought to himself:<i> What a problematic person to deal with. Luckily, I\u2019m well prepared.</i></p><br/><p>Nodding, Zhou Weiqing gave a confident look as he said: \u201cYou\u2019re right, Principal. As they saying goes, seeing is believing. I believe you should have noticed what the God Tier Consolidated Equipment was in the design right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cai Cai inclined her head and said: \u201cA pair of hammers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she finished speaking, Zhou Weiqing\u2019s right hand waved outward, though not in her direction. A thick dark gold light sprang forth, instantaneously enveloping Zhou Weiqing\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsolidating Equipment God Protective Aura?!\u201d This was the second time Cai Cai had lost her composure and exclaimed out loud since meeting Zhou Weiqing. The next moment, she saw a pair of exaggeratedly huge hammers appear in Zhou Weiqing\u2019s hands. As soon as they appeared, there was no need for Zhou Weiqing to show further, and Cai Cai knew it was definitely a God Tier Consolidated Equipment. After all, that aura wasn\u2019t something that any ordinary equipment could display.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing struck the hammer on the table lightly, causing a soft *bang*. When he lifted it back up, the solid table had a mark left on it. The mark seemed to hold strange elaborate meanings, though it only came from the inscriptions on the hammer shaft.</p><br/><p>\u201cPrincipal Cai Cai can verify that with a Zong Stage Consolidating Equipment Master. He will tell you what it means. Ah, I can tell you now as well, what it means is it is the first of a Legendary Consolidated Equipment Set\u2026 and there are a total of ten in the entire set.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, Zhou Weiqing kept the hammers with the wave of his hands, at the same time retrieving and keeping the design sheet which was on the table. Standing for a second time, he glanced at Cai Cai, whose brow was furrowed in deep thought, and turned to leave. As he did so, he thought to himself: <i>I\u2019m hungry, I\u2019m going to eat now! Who asked you all to try to pressure me, threaten me! Hmph, I\u2019ll scare you all away. </i>Zhou Weiqing did not hesitate to show his hammers in order to win the battle of spirits with Cai Cai, letting her know that even though he came from Heavenly Bow Empire, he wasn\u2019t someone she could easily bully. He wanted to show that he had a background that wasn\u2019t easily trifled with, even for the Fei Li Empire. Only then could he reverse his untenable position into one where he had a driving seat of sorts. Furthermore, he was not totally lying. Indeed, this time if he was really chased out, when he grew to his full power, he would definitely take revenge on the Fei Li Empire. This was undoubtedly the truth, as he was not some goody goody two shoes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a while.\u201d Just as Zhou Weiqing was about to reach the door, Cai Cai suddenly called out to him.</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing turned back around, his face expressionless and calm as he said: \u201cMa\u2019am Principal, is there anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cai Cai smiled and said: \u201cStudent Zhou Weiqing, in the future when you create Consolidating Equipment Scrolls, can the academy reserve some\u2026 as well as our Fei Li Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing shrugged and said: \u201cWhy not?\u201d After saying that, he pulled on the door and left swiftly.</p><br/><p>In truth, he had a strong urge in his heart to just reject her outright, and not give her the face to back down simply. However, he knew that he had already scored the minor victory, and her position was after all just much stronger than his. This was the Fei Li Empire, and he was still going to study in the academy for four more years. Furthermore, it was just him and Shangguan Bing\u2019er alone here, and it would definitely be unwise to alienate the entire upper echelons of the academy, and cause himself more trouble. As such, he finally let her have the face, after all overall he had gotten the upper hand in this round. If he truly wanted to totally beat or suppress this woman, it would only be possible one day when his power was totally beyond hers.</p><br/><p>After Zhou Weiqing had left her office, Cai Cai still stood there silently. After a while, she finally shook her head and sighed, muttering to herself: \u201cIt looks like the Heavenly Bow Empire will have the chance to rise up. I\u2019ll have to tell the military headquarters to perhaps give some aid to them. As for this little brat, I\u2019ll have to keep my eye on him. God Tier Consolidating Equipment Master... Legendary Consolidating Equipment Set\u2026 Zhou Weiqing, you have indeed made me look at you in a different light.\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time Zhou Weiqing reached the canteen, most of the people had already finished eating. Shangguan Bing\u2019er sat alone at a table, silently waiting for him. Kou Rui stood at the side not far from her, and Yan Zhexi was also actually standing together with him. With Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s beauty, there was naturally no shortage of people trying to approach her, but the two of them stopped all of them. Normally, this would have been impossible, but the nobles had just been warned by the academy authorities yesterday.</p><br/><p>\u201cBing\u2019er, you haven\u2019t eaten yet?\u201d Zhou Weiqing saw two plates of food on the table, and asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er smiled faintly and said: \u201cI wanted to wait and eat together with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After arguing with Cai Cai, Zhou Weiqing had felt a little tired in his heart. However, looking at Shangguan Bing\u2019er\u2019s peaceful gaze and hearing her words, he felt a warmth calm his heart. No matter what or when, she was there to support him, any amount of suffering and fatigue on his part was worth it!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s eat then.\u201d Zhou Weiqing gazed deeply at her, and did not attempt to seize the opportunity to tease her. At this moment, his heart was filled with love and warmth, feeling the need to protect this girl in front of him forever.</p><br/><p>Kou Rui and Yan Zhexi both left quietly when they saw Zhou Weiqing reach the table, and as the other students slowly drifted out of the canteen, it seemed to Shangguan Bing\u2019er and Zhou Weiqing that they were alone in the world.</p><br/><p>After their lunch, the two of them headed to the main square on the academy grounds, finding a bench and basking in the sun. \u201cBing\u2019er, are you tired after this morning\u2019s test?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er said: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not tired. How can us Heavenly Jewel Masters be tired so easily? How was your test?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Weiqing said rather helplessly: \u201cLooks like I have a high chance of cleaning the toilet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er furrowed her brow and was just about to say something, but Zhou Weiqing held a finger to her red lips. \u201cDo not worry for me, I will handle it. Now your mission is\u2026 an afternoon nap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Domineeringly pulling her into his arms, he let her lean into her arms, smiling in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Bing\u2019er did not tell him about what happened with Difuya earlier, as she knew very clearly his temper. If Zhou Weiqing found out what happened, he would not let things go easily. Now, leaning on him, she felt a sense of security, and as they relaxed under the warm sun rays, her long eyelashes slowly closed, and soon enough, her breath settled and evened.</p><br/><p>It was only when it was time for the afternoon class when Zhou Weiqing woke her up. Although he did not sleep, hugging her through the noon period, he felt rested and his mind refreshed, with a sense of clarity.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
