As she looked out at the Mountain and Sea Realm, she spoke, her voice cool, \u201cThe Mountain and Sea Realm is doomed.... All bloodlines will be wiped out. Nothing will remain. The fact that you have been able to keep fighting till this point shows that the 33 Heavens truly underestimated you people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever... with absolute power like ours, you will fade away into the passage of time. The glory of the Immortal World should have become nothing more than ash. The fact that you are still gasping for life will merely ensure that, through all history, Immortals will be scorned and derided.\u201d</p><br/><p>As her words echoed out, they could be heard by all of the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm curious. Did you people actually think that there was still hope for you? After the 33 Heavens are the other two great worlds, the Devil Realm and the Immortal God Continent. Those two great powers are immeasurably close....</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat makes you think your trifling Mountains and Seas could possibly fight them? Your bloodlines will be expunged. Your minds will be erased. None of you... will survive.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the 8-Essences Paragon looked out at the Mountain and Sea Realm, nothing she saw there was worthy of her gaze, not even Meng Hao. Instead, she focused on a location that only she could see, between the Eighth and Ninth Mountains. There, the other 8-Essences Paragon was fighting someone who even she could not completely fathom. He was also the only person who could strike fear into her heart.</p><br/><p>As for the other mysterious experts who existed, either they didn't wish to make a move against her, or for various other reasons were content to simply observe what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cShui Dongliu.... You are simply a body possessed by a discarnate soul. In that case... what exactly are you trying to accomplish? This war was obviously fated to play out this way.\u201d The 8-Essences female Paragon frowned. The fact that she couldn\u2019t unravel this mystery caused doubt to bubble up in her heart.</p><br/><p>The war of the Mountains and Seas continued. The Eighth Mountain shuddered as the Outsider army fought bitterly with the Mountain and Sea cultivators. Heaven shook and the Earth quaked. The starry sky was shattered, and even the Eighth Mountain itself was beginning to crack and crumble.</p><br/><p>Paragon Sea Dream and the Paragon puppet were still fighting the large-headed expert, who fought in a very bizarre fashion. He was adept at using fleshly body techniques, and was able to single-handedly take on both of them, and even prevent them from slipping away to fight elsewhere.</p><br/><p>In other areas, vicious Outsiders fought bitterly with the Mountain and Sea cultivators.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was also in great danger, surrounded by more than ten enemies, including giants. Roars filled the air, and the glow of magical techniques rose up. Meng Hao\u2019s hair was completely disheveled, and he was going all out with everything he had at his disposal. The Life-Extermination, Bedevilment, and God-Slaying fists shook the starry sky. Finally, he overwhelmed one of his opponents, who coughed up blood as he was completely annihilated.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was gasping for breath as he turned and split the starry sky with the Battle Weapon. A brilliant cascade of light flashed out toward two enemies, who were completely shocked as their heads flew off of their bodies.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao's hands were shaking; the price he had paid to be able to kill three individuals in quick succession was that he was blasted by the divine abilities from the rest of the group. Even worse, he was hit by a fist strike from the giant.</p><br/><p>BOOOOMMMMMM!</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed out of Meng Hao\u2019s mouth, but thanks to the meat jelly, he wasn't grievously injured. Even as he began to recover, thanks to the Green Emperor\u2019s Eternal Incantation, his eyes glimmered with brutality, and he extended his left hand, unleashing the Star Plucking Magic to grab one of the enemy cultivators. Even as he was about to crush the man's throat, the other surrounding enemies unleashed numerous divine abilities.</p><br/><p>In the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint, Meng Hao laughed viciously and refused to retreat. Ceasing his attempt to drag the cultivator toward him, he lunged forward and head-butted the man in the forehead.</p><br/><p>A boom rang out, accompanied by a bloodcurdling scream, whereupon the man\u2019s head exploded. Meng Hao was completely soaked in blood and gore, making him look thoroughly vicious as he threw his head back and howled. The surrounding enemies exchanged glances, then suddenly flew up into the air and unexpectedly began to merge together!</p><br/><p>Their bodies were apparently formed by strange powers, and had been pieced together from other bodies. Now, they began to merge together. Even the giants joined in, and in the blink of an eye, all of them transformed into a single new entity!</p><br/><p>It was a colossal giant, fully 3,000 meters tall, which immediately began to emanate a crushing pressure. Most shocking of all was that the giant had eight faces on different parts of its body.</p><br/><p>Those eight faces belonged to the eight people who had formed the body, six of whom were cultivators and two of whom were giants of the God tribe.</p><br/><p>Howling, the giant began to charge toward Meng Hao, right hand spinning through the air with explosive speed to almost instantly appear in front of him. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes widened, and he immediately summoned the Paragon Bridge to defend himself.</p><br/><p>A huge boom echoed out, and blood sprayed out of Meng Hao\u2019s mouth. Even as Meng Hao staggered backward several paces, the giant also fell back, trembling, all eight faces letting out roars.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao wiped the blood from his lips, and his eyes flickered with killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cParagon level power?\u201d</p><br/><p>The giant ground to a halt and glared at Meng Hao for a moment before bursting forward again. As it closed in on Meng Hao, he suddenly opened his mouth wide and unleashed a mighty roar upon Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The roar of a God!</p><br/><p>A shockwave burst out into the starry sky, tearing rifts open. At the same time, the sound waves coming from the giant\u2019s mouth turned corporeal as they blasted toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>When they hit him, blood oozed out of his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. The meat jelly armor began to crack and crumble, although it held on and continued to protect Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s right hand quivered as he was shoved back. The sound was so intensely powerful that, were it not for the meat jelly, his organs would already have been crushed into a paste.</p><br/><p>The giant then strode forward, unleashing a palm strike. Meng Hao, being unable to dodge, met it directly. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he was flung back. More cracks spread out across the meat jelly armor, and yet it continued to hold fast. Meng Hao felt bad about that, but in this critical moment of life or death, he had to stay focused on the giant.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a divine ability like that before....\u201d he thought, his eyes flickering with killing intent.</p><br/><p>The roar didn't last for very long. However, as soon as it faded away, the giant roared again, and the explosive sound wave once again closed in on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Even as the second sound wave closed in, the starstone in Meng Hao\u2019s eye flickered, spreading out to cover his entire body. As the roar bore down, he transformed into an asteroid, which braced up against the sound and then began to move toward the giant.</p><br/><p>Under the power of the sound wave, the asteroid began to transform into ash, shrinking down rapidly. By the time it was only about thirty meters away from the giant, the asteroid form collapsed, and Meng Hao appeared. However, he quickly transformed into an azure roc, which shot onward at incredible speed.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the azure roc was flayed into chunks of gore and blood, but it managed to continue on. Despite the giant falling into retreat, Meng Hao was now less than ten meters away from it!</p><br/><p>That distance... was enough!</p><br/><p>Even as the azure roc collapsed, the giant's pupils constricted with fear. It was at this point that Meng Hao\u2019s human form stepped out from the remains of the roc. A murderous aura erupted out as he hefted the Battle Weapon and slashed it down viciously toward the retreating giant!</p><br/><p>Within the scintillating blade light, the image of a parrot could be seen. The parrot seemed determined, bereaved, even maddened. It was the first time Meng Hao had ever seen it in such a state. The sound of the screaming blade caused the giant's eyes to widen with disbelief, and then the blade slashed into it.</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!!</p><br/><p>The giant staggered back, simultaneously collapsing into countless pieces. Numerous miserable shrieks could be heard as the five of the eight bodies which had formed the giant transformed into ash and powder. Simultaneously, roars of disbelief could be heard echoing out from one of the land masses speeding toward the Mountain and Sea Realm out in the Vast Expanse.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the three people who had not been killed were now staring at Meng Hao\u2019s blade in terror. Without any hesitation, they began to flee.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was pale white as he instantly gave chase. His speed was incredible, and he caught up with one of them almost immediately, unhesitatingly grabbing the man and unleashing the Blood Demon Grand Magic. Instantly, he began to absorb his qi and blood, as well as his soul, which in turn increased the effectiveness of the Green Emperor\u2019s Eternal Incantation.</p><br/><p>The cultivator screamed, and almost instantly withered up. In the blink of an eye, he became a dessicated corpse. At the same time, Meng Hao visibly recovered, then turned to pursue the other two cultivators.</p><br/><p>Each one cried the same thing. \u201cSave me!\u201d</p><br/><p>They fled at top speed, shocked expressions on their faces. These were not cultivators from the 33 Heavens. They had possessed bodies to come here, and were not the type of people who could be killed easily. If they died, they would be resurrected back in their homeland. After all, what had come here were not their full souls.</p><br/><p>And yet, they had just watched this stranger kill five of their compatriots. Most terrifying of all was that not only did their soul fragments perish here, but his bizarre blade caused their true forms to perish as well!</p><br/><p>Even more terrifying was that this person could absorb their qi, their blood, and their souls. That left them completely shaken and in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can really kill us!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be possible!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>In their terror, they fled at top speed. Meng Hao was just about to give chase when suddenly his expression flickered, and he looked up in the direction of the shattered Sixth Mountain.</p><br/><p>There, the three Doyens who were keeping the 8-Essences Paragon sealed were now in a state of extreme withering. That was especially true of the Heaven Severing Doyen, who had apparently already run out of life force.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep me sealed here,\u201d the female Paragon said coolly. Then, she slowly reached out toward the sealing mark itself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
