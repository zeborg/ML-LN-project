The Blood Demon Sect was the center, and surrounding it was a vast sea of cultivators unleashing magical techniques that gave rise to enormous ripples. The earth was smashed and the air shattered. It was as if doomsday had arrived.</p><br/><p>More than 100,000 cultivators charged across the battlefield madly toward the Blood Demon Sect disciples that they had besieged this entire time. The Blood Demon Sect disciples had repressed themselves to the limit, and now their savagery exploded out.</p><br/><p>\u201cKILL THEM!!\u201d There were tens of thousands of Blood Demon Sect disciples and more than 100,000 enemy cultivators. Despite the fact that they were significantly outnumbered, they did not hesitate to wade into the bloody battle.</p><br/><p>This was their sect, and this war was being waged to exterminate them. Not a single one of them would be left alive. Since that was the case, they would take some of the enemy with them!</p><br/><p>Or perhaps\u2026 they would be able to slaughter their way to a chance for survival.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered as he retreated back to Blood Prince Gorge. Xu Qing was shivering slightly when he landed in front of her, but when she saw him she took a deep breath and gazed at him with gentle eyes.</p><br/><p>He embraced her, then looked up at the vast array of enemy forces charging toward them. He watched as the Blood Demon Sect disciples charged madly into the fray, and the final, decisive battle began.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d he asked Xu Qing softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she replied with a chuckle.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s second true self hovered in midair, eyes glittering. He raised his hand, causing the wooden sword to circulate around him as his peak Dao Seeking cultivation base surged. Then, he turned into a prismatic streak of light that shot toward the false Immortal puppet.</p><br/><p>The puppet immediately met him in combat and explosions rang out, sending boundless ripples out in all directions. This became a third battlefield, the second being where Patriarch Blood Demon was fighting.</p><br/><p>On the ground below, the slaughter commenced. Shouting rang out, along with the sounds of killing. The Blood Demon Sect disciples were in a frenzy, holding nothing back, even sustaining injury and burning longevity. When they were too severely injured, they would smile bitterly and then choose to self-detonate.</p><br/><p>Rumbling filled the battlefield as the Blood Demon Sect disciples massacred the enemy with savagery and madness.</p><br/><p>One particular Blood Demon Sect disciple with a Nascent Soul cultivation base, received a fatal blow. Using the last bit of his energy, he lunged forward and buried his teeth into his opponent\u2019s throat and ripped out a huge chunk of bloody flesh. As his opponent screamed miserably, the Blood Demon Sect disciple laughed maniacally and then self-detonated.</p><br/><p>Another Blood Demon Sect disciple unleashed a forbidden art. His entire cultivation base and fleshly body, even his soul, transformed into a drop of blood which stabbed through the foreheads of multiple opponents. After slaying eight people in a row, he exploded.</p><br/><p>Ruthlessly savage!</p><br/><p>Due to the berserk fighting of the Blood Demon Sect, the more than 100,000 enemies were kept outside of the mountain peaks, and were incapable of stepping half a pace into the interior of the sect. The vicious slaughter being carried out by the Blood Demon Sect completely shook their opponents.</p><br/><p>In a very short period of time, the Blood Demon Sect lost more than 10,000 cultivators. However, the enemy forces paid a heavy price; more than 20,000 of their number were killed!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao did not participate in the fighting, but rather stood outside Blood Prince Gorge, surrounded by Blood Demon Sect disciples, silently observing the battle. To the other disciples, their Blood Prince had already paid a heavy enough price. Now\u2026 it was time for them to do their part.</p><br/><p>Up in midair, the Dawn Immortal\u2019s clone began to shine with a brilliant light. The illusory Resurrection Lily behind her almost seemed corporeal. She was now relying purely on her own strength to keep Patriarch Blood Demon\u2019s clone in check.</p><br/><p>Rumbling filled the air as they attacked each other. As for the red-haired Golden Frost Sect Patriarch and the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch, they circled around the area, occasionally attempting to interfere with the battle, but mostly just setting up spell formations in an attempt to prevent Patriarch Blood Demon from breaking free.</p><br/><p>In a different location, Meng Hao\u2019s second true self was fighting the false Immortal puppet. The black-robed Patriarch\u2019s Nascent Divinity was now driving the puppet, and thanks to his towering killing intent and the puppet\u2019s incredible strength, Meng Hao\u2019s second true self was slowly being pushed back.</p><br/><p>The gap between the peak of Dao Seeking and a false Immortal was too vast!</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Meng Hao\u2019s second true self had the Wooden Time Sword, and the Immortal\u2019s soul inside of him made him just capable of holding his own in the battle.</p><br/><p>However, anyone could see that eventually, the Blood Demon Sect\u2026 would be defeated.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE!\u201d roared the more than 100,000 enemy cultivators as they surged onto the offensive once more. In the middle of all the fighting could be seen the Golden Frost Sect puppet with the Dao Seeking aura. Its eyes flashed as it advanced cautiously through the crowds.</p><br/><p>The cultivators who made up this Golden Frost Sect puppet were already thoroughly frightened by Meng Hao. They had looked on helplessly as the Solitary Sword Sect\u2019s early Dao Seeking expert was killed, and the Li Clan Patriarch severely injured. Then there was the black-robed Patriarch, who they didn\u2019t even come close to matching up to.</p><br/><p>They would have long since fled, but this was war, and they could not.</p><br/><p>Even as the Golden Frost Sect puppet started to advance, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes began to flicker with icy coldness. He looked at the puppet, and as he did, it stopped in its tracks.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked down at Xu Qing and began to speak, his voice soft. \u201cI\u2019m going to kill a lot of people today. If you don\u2019t want to see so much bloodshed, you can always close your eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Qing looked up at him with a tender expression, then closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>Holding Xu Qing tight with one arm, he flicked his sleeve, causing the war chariot to appear. He stepped inside, and the war chariot began to shine with a blinding light. Numerous beasts magically appeared, and they roared as they began to pull the chariot forward.</p><br/><p>He stood there in the war chariot, Xu Qing at his side. Now that he had reappeared on the battlefield, he once again became the focus of attention. Everything he said and did would be noticed, and would affect the overall situation on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The war chariot charged into the crowds, and instantly people were killed. In the blink of an eye, a bloody path was carved out across the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Bloodcurdling screams filled the air constantly. Anyone who was struck by Meng Hao\u2019s war chariot died in a spray of blood. Soon, the chariot itself was the color of blood.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face, hair, and clothing were also soaked in blood, but he didn\u2019t care. His eyes were cold and grim as he waved his hand, causing the Ninth Mountain to appear as well as the fourth level vortex of the Blood Demon Grand Magic.</p><br/><p>He was no longer the scholar he had been. Nor was he the same Meng Hao of the Southern Domain. After joining the Blood Demon Sect, his heart had begun to fill with an insatiable desire to kill.</p><br/><p>That desire to kill was the Devil in his heart!</p><br/><p>Be a Devil in heart. Bedevilment! As a Devil, carry out mass slaughter!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao lifted his head and roared as the war chariot shot forward, this time toward the Golden Frost Sect puppet. The Golden Frost Sect puppet\u2019s face fell, and it fell back at top speed. It performed an incantation gesture, causing the glint of blades and swords to spin toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao made no attempt to dodge. The war chariot smashed forward, crushing the incoming blades and swords like dried weeds as it barreled toward the puppet.</p><br/><p>Another explosion rattled out, and popping sounds could be heard from the puppet as cracks spread out across its body. It retreated again, waving its hand to produce a golden greatsword which then slashed down toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao snorted coldly, clenched his right hand into a fist, and punched out.</p><br/><p>The instant his punch connected with the greatsword, cracks spread out across the sword, and it exploded into pieces. Having lost the greatsword, the Golden Frost Sect puppet appeared to be in a state of despair. It was incapable of dodging the war chariot, which slammed directly into its body.</p><br/><p>A boom could be heard as the Golden Frost Sect puppet fell to pieces. It transformed into four Spirit Severing cultivators, all of whom were coughing up blood. Faces aghast, they were about to flee, only to find that the fourth level vortex of the Blood Demon Grand Magic was waiting for them.</p><br/><p>The vortex rumbled into motion, and not a single one of the four were able to escape. They were enveloped by the vortex, and their bodies began to wither. Their cultivation bases were sucked away; even genuine early Dao Seeking cultivators would be incapable of getting out of this vortex. As for these four\u2026 how could they possibly escape death!?</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Their bodies exploded, and their cultivation bases were gone. Their Nascent Divinities flew out, whereupon the flag of three streamers appeared to sweep them up.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this small victory did nothing to change the tide of the battle as a whole. In the same moment that Meng Hao vanquished the Golden Frost Sect puppet, booming sounds could be heard from up in mid-air as his second true self coughed up blood and retreated at top speed.</p><br/><p>The false Immortal puppet, under the control of the black-robed Patriarch, was emanating an incredible energy. Immortal qi surged about, and the air around it shattered. Natural law bowed before him, as if it were the ultimate sovereign.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood Demon Sect! Today, you will be exterminated!\u201d cried the black-robed man from within the false Immortal puppet, his voice laced with killing intent. \u201cMeng Hao, you twerp, you will not escape death today!\u201d</p><br/><p>The enormous puppet flickered, suddenly changing directions to attack, not the second true self, but Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s killing intent filled the air, but he was well aware of the gap in power between him and the puppet. The war chariot thrummed as he retreated. Unfortunately, the false Immortal puppet only continued to pursue him, and even increased its speed. It got closer and closer!</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t seem as if there were any place Meng Hao could flee to. The false Immortal puppet would catch him no matter where he went!</p><br/><p>His second true self flickered and shot toward him. However, Meng Hao knew that there was nowhere to flee to. He suddenly grinned hideously, and then stopped in place. He raised his right hand, and the Blood Demon Grand Magic appeared, along with the Ninth Mountain, the Black White Pearls and the Blood Immortal divine abilities!</p><br/><p>He also summoned the \u2018withering\u2019 character, and called the Ji Clan Blood Clone from down on the battlefield. In addition, the Resurrection Lily blossomed behind him, writhing viciously.</p><br/><p>And finally\u2026 he clenched his right fist!</p><br/><p>As for the second true self, he utilized his peak Dao Seeking cultivation base to unleash the Solitary Yang Sky!</p><br/><p>It combined with the Wooden Time Sword, a river of 70,000 years of Time power, and everything else, to form the most powerful attack that Meng Hao could currently unleash.</p><br/><p>He was battling a false Immortal!</p><br/><p>The entire battlefield shook violently!</p><br/><p>A shocking boom rang out that turned the heads of countless people on the battlefield. The air was shattered, and the false Immortal puppet not only stopped in place, it retreated three measures!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s second true self spat up a huge mouthful of blood and stumbled backward. As for Meng Hao himself, blood also sprayed from his mouth. However, his body did not collapse due to the protection of the chariot. The war chariot tumbled end-over-end, and the qi of Immortal Shows the Way vanished, causing the war chariot to also disappear.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao held Xu Qing tight as he fled. When he looked back, he saw the false Immortal Puppet laughing maniacally and proceeding forward with killing intent swirling.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to die!\u201d roared the puppet, raising its right hand. Shockingly, a multi-colored glow appeared, swirling Immortal qi which transformed into an Immortal lotus. The lotus pulsed, and a massive pressure rumbled out.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that\u2026.</p><br/><p>Up in midair, Patriarch Blood Demon\u2019s clone, the one that was fighting the Dawn Immortal, suddenly sighed. Then, it turned and vanished.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the cave in Mount Blood Demon, the armored Patriarch Blood Demon sat cross-legged in the Blood Pool. Suddenly, his eyes snapped open, and they radiated a glow the color of blood.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
