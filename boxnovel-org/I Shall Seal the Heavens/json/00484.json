The casualties amongst the Crow Divinity Tribe increased, including the neo-demons.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Five Poisons Tribe paid a heavy price, but not as much as the Crow Divinity Tribe. Because of the fierce pressure of the battle, the Crow Divinity Tribe forces were now showing signs that they might fall apart.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Meng Hao was still stuck within the blood-colored seal. Unfortunately, no matter what ideas he came up with for how to escape, nothing worked. Minor teleportation and magical items, even the flag of three streamers could not even temporarily put a dent into the seal.</p><br/><p>He tried everything, the Lotus Time Formation, the three strange wooden swords. He even tried Han Shan\u2019s Immortal\u2019s Sword, but based on his observations, it would take three days for it to break through the seal.</p><br/><p>There seemed to be only one option left; that was the Dancing Sword Qi. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes turned red as he began to condense Alcohol Qi outside of his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis blood contains the power of Karma. It must be the some blood from a Ji Clan Patriarch of an ancient generation. If this drop contains such power after all these years, just how strong was this person when he was alive?\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s mind trembled as the Alcohol Qi swept out and the Dancing Sword Qi began to congeal inside of him.</p><br/><p>He could think of no other method other than using the Dancing Sword Qi, which was somewhat of a pity. He actually didn\u2019t know if even the Dancing Sword Qi would enable him to break out; however, he did know that the Crow Divinity Tribe could not hold out for much longer.</p><br/><p>He took a deep breath and was just about to cause the power of the Dancing Sword Qi to explode out, when suddenly he looked at the wall created by the blood-colored seal. He looked at the rippling blood and then suddenly felt a tremor run through his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood\u2026 blood\u2026.\u201d In this moment it felt as if lightning were coursing through his head. An audacious and perhaps even insane idea had suddenly risen up in his mind.</p><br/><p>The idea caused him to suddenly begin to pant, and hesitate regarding using the Dancing Sword Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoul Blood. This is Ji Clan Soul Blood. I already have Soul Blood from that Ji Clan Quasi-Array Cultivator [1. Meng Hao killed Ji Hongdong way back in chapter 306]. If I add this blood, that\u2019s two drops!</p><br/><p>\u201cI have Ji Nineteen sealed up inside the blood-colored mask. If I extract some Soul Blood from him, that means I have three generations of Ji Clan blood. Using the Blood Immortal magic, I can form a Blood Clone!</p><br/><p>\u201cThree generations of blood can form a Blood Clone. Nine Generations can make a Blood Divinity. A Blood Divinity\u2026 should possesses the power of Ancestral Awakening. The manifestation of powerful Ji Clan experts could once again appear! I would be able to wield some of the strength of one of their Immortals!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao began to pant. The idea continued to develop in his head, quickly filling his entire brain. All of a sudden, he realized that his current situation was a golden opportunity!</p><br/><p>If he missed this chance, it would most likely be very difficult to acquire more Ji blood. Furthermore, this particular drop of Ji blood was not ordinary; it clearly had an incredible background.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily need to break open the blood seal; instead I can choose\u2026 to use it to make myself a Ji Clan Blood Clone!\u201d Panting, a bright light began to shine in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I need right now, then, is some blood from Ji Nineteen!\u201d After a moment of deliberation, decisiveness filled his eyes.</p><br/><p>He lifted his hand and pushed it down onto blood-coloured mask. He sent his Spiritual Sense inside, causing himself to instantly appearing directly in front of Ji Nineteen.</p><br/><p>Ji Nineteen looked incredibly weak, but his eyes shone with a strange glow. He could sense the aura on the outside world and knew that the will of a Ji Clan ancestor was there.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it\u2026?\u201d he wondered to himself. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible. It\u2019s so ancient! How could the blood of such an ancient ancestor exist\u2026. It exceeds the history of the Clan itself. Just who could it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ji Nineteen was so shaken that he didn\u2019t even notice that Meng Hao had arrived. Meng Hao materialized in the world of the mask, a vicious expression on his face. He reached out his right hand and unhesitatingly pushed down onto Ji Nineteen\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>A ferocious expression suddenly appeared on Ji Nineteen\u2019s face. Before he could even begin to struggle, the aura of the Lotus Sword Formation emanated out from Meng Hao, entering the blood-colored mask and approaching Ji Nineteen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can struggle and fight back if you want,\u201d said Meng Hao grimly. \u201cRight now, I don\u2019t care if I can\u2019t get any more information about the Ji Clan from you. I want a drop of Soul Blood. Struggle, refuse, fight back\u2026 all such actions will be futile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you cooperate, then I\u2019ll take the blood and leave. Resist me, then I will exterminate your soul and take a drop of Soul Blood by force!\u201d With that, he closed his eyes and rotated his Cultivation base. Four great totems magically appeared. He focused all the power of the great Blood Immortal magic. Everything was focused on extracting Soul Blood from Ji Nineteen.</p><br/><p>The aura of the Lotus Sword Formation neared, and the power of Time suddenly began to rotate. To ensure his success in the matter, Meng Hao even called out to the sleeping Blood Mastiff!</p><br/><p>The mastiff was sleeping, but as the years had passed, Meng Hao could sense that\u2026 it would soon awaken!</p><br/><p>Ji Nineteen\u2019s face fell. He could hear the killing intent and coldness in Meng Hao\u2019s voice, and could tell that Meng Hao without a doubt was speaking the truth to him.</p><br/><p>His mind trembled. Maybe he wouldn\u2019t struggle, but how could he be willing to comply? However, the power of Time neared, causing his face to flicker. The flag of three streamers tightened around him, causing him to pant. Finally, the aura of the mastiff neared, filled with the power of Spirit Severing. Ji Nineteen could sense Meng Hao\u2019s decisiveness, and suddenly was filled with an intense sense of grave crisis.</p><br/><p>He suddenly realized that Meng Hao wasn\u2019t necessarily incapable of killing him. He just didn\u2019t want to at the moment. Ji Nineteen knew that going against Meng Hao in this moment meant that he would most likely die in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Sensing Meng Hao\u2019s determination, he suddenly began to waver.</p><br/><p>Even as Meng Hao forced the Soul Blood out of Ji Nineteen, the battle between the Crow Divinity Tribe and the Five Poisons Tribe was reaching a climax.</p><br/><p>The Outlander Beast was not a match for the all three of the totemic Sacred Ancients. Even with the parrot and the meat jelly, it was still injured. Its body trembled and its aura was growing weak. However, it still roared as it fought back against the Sacred Ancients, preventing them from passing it.</p><br/><p>In mid-air, the Nascent Soul Elders of the Crow Divinity Tribe were pale-faced. They coughed up blood as they sustained serious injuries. They were like lamps that were running out of oil.</p><br/><p>The rest of the Tribe members were locked in bitter combat. Casualties were heavy as both sides killed back and forth. The booming of self-detonation could be heard everywhere. Even the neo-demons were in sore straits. Big Hairy was severely injured and the Wild Giant was coughing up blood. Gu La\u2019s face was pale, and his aura was nothing more than a slender strand.</p><br/><p>As for the Greatfather, he had burned his life force almost to the limit. His body emanated a strong aura of death. However, he still went all out to restrain the High Priest.</p><br/><p>\u201cExalted Sacred Ancient\u2026. We can\u2019t hold on for very much longer\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExalted Sacred Ancient, please, break through that seal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExalted Sacred Ancient\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were not spoken out loud. Instead, they were the prayers of the Tribe members, words spoken in their hearts, containing their will. They merged together, to form a power of will.</p><br/><p>As the power of their will reverberated out, Meng Hao, inside the blood-colored seal, suddenly opened his eyes. A drop of Soul Blood flew out from inside the blood-colored mask to land in his palm.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face was pale. It had not been easy extracting the Soul Blood from Ji Nineteen. Had he not become so much stronger than when he first captured Ji Nineteen, it would have been virtually impossible. Even still, he was as exhausted as if he had been battling for days against a powerful opponent.</p><br/><p>Now was not the time for rest, though. He waved his right hand, and immediately, another drop of Soul Blood appeared next to Ji Nineteen\u2019s. This was the blood he had acquired that year from the Ji Clan Quasi-Array Chosen outside of the Rebirth Cave.</p><br/><p>In addition to the blood in the blood-colored seal, he now had three drops in total!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a deep breath and then began to perform an incantation gesture with both hands as he employed the great Blood Immortal magic to form a Blood Clone!</p><br/><p>\u201cMerge!\u201d he growled. Instantly, the two blood drops fused together and then shot into the blood-colored wall in front of him.</p><br/><p>All of these drops of blood had a common origin. The instant they fused together, Meng Hao crossed his legs and closed his eyes. As he performed continuous incantation gestures, drops of sweat as large as beans began to pour down his face. His hands moved faster and faster, causing streams of sealing marks to float out. At the same, the blood-colored seal around him began to shrink.</p><br/><p>As the bizarre shrinking process began, shocking, indistinct screams of rage began to emanate out from the blood-colored seal. Instantly, the battlefield was shaken. The faces of the Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators instantly fell. Even the three totemic Sacred Ancients looked astonished.</p><br/><p>When the Crow Divinity Tribe members heard the sound of it, they were instantly invigorated.</p><br/><p>Tens of thousands of people watched as the surface of the blood-colored sphere was covered with bizarre ripples. As the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather watched on, his heart filled with inexplicable fear and trembling. He suddenly had a very, very bad feeling.</p><br/><p>With a roar, he performed a two-handed incantation gesture as he continued to reinforce the seal.</p><br/><p>Despite that, a roaring sound filled the air as the blood sphere rapidly shrank from thirty meters wide to only fifteen. As it did, 20,000 distorted faces suddenly appeared on the surface of the sphere. These faces were the spirits that the Five Poisons Tribe members had merged with their drop of Heavenly Blood, as a means to control the its will.</p><br/><p>Rumbling filled the air as 10,000 of the faces were expelled. The blood sphere shrank again. Now it was only about ten meters wide. A sense of shocking purity suddenly appeared within it.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a horrifying aura blasted out from inside. This aura vastly exceeded that which had resulted from Meng Hao\u2019s previous Blood Clones. This aura shook Heaven and Earth, and caused the entire sky to turn red, as if something completely inhuman were about to come into existence!</p><br/><p>The intensity of the aura exceeded that of the Spirit Severing stage, reaching an indescribable level that caused the faces of everyone present to fill with astonishment. The powerful experts of the Five Poisons Tribe gasped in stupefaction.</p><br/><p>They knew now exactly what was happening. The spirits of the Five Poisons Tribe Cultivators were being expelled from the blood sphere. That meant that the blood was no longer under the control of the Five Poisons Clan!</p><br/><p>A roaring sound like thunder rolled out in all directions, shaking all of the Cultivators on the battlefield, as well as the neo-demons and the Five Poison Clan\u2019s totemic Sacred Ancients.</p><br/><p>Even as faces flickered in astonishment, another roar sounded out as another 10,000 of the Five Poisons Tribe spirits were expelled from the blood.</p><br/><p>A fearsome aura rose up into the sky!! Everything grew dim, and the clouds were swept away. The entire world became a blood-colored hell!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must not be allowed to emerge!\u201d roared the Five Poisons Tribe Greatfather. He shot forward, going all out to prevent Meng Hao from breaking free. Blood sprayed from the mouth of the High Priest as he managed to extricate himself from the Crow Divinity Greatfather. Face filled with fear, he too shot forward to assist.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
