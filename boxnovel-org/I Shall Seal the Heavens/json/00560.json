The woman had floated over and bumped into him, and there was nothing he could do about it. Most vile of all was that she was blocking his view.</p><br/><p>Now, he couldn\u2019t see even a bit of the world outside.</p><br/><p>She smelled wonderful, and her body was supple and lithe. Meng Hao\u2019s face slowly pressed down into softness, which almost completely buried him.</p><br/><p>His eyes went wide as he realized that, just barely visible when he looked down, was an exquisite sight that he rarely had a chance to gaze upon. And yet, the only thing that existed in Meng Hao\u2019s mind was fury.</p><br/><p>What he wanted to look at was not this woman, but the world behind her. Being able to observe that world ahead of time was the entire source of his advantage. However as of this moment, his advantage\u2026 was being ruined.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d Meng Hao grumbled to himself. Then, he took a deep breath of the wonderful fragrance surrounding his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cExtremely ridiculous!\u201d He wanted to lift his head up, but was incapable of moving his body at all. All he could do was breathe in that fragrant aroma. Meng Hao now existed in a world, not of a starry sky, but of this delicate fragrance that, regardless of whether he wanted it to or not, was permeating deep into his soul.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had no other option than to do his best to commit to memory the image of the outside world that he had seen briefly. Gradually, a picture appeared within his mind.</p><br/><p>The picture was all based on his memories. It depicted a mountain range that stretched farther than the eye could see. Mountains rose and fell, actually growing taller in height as they stretched off into the distance.</p><br/><p>It seemed as if this mountain range was actually an entire world. If he remembered correctly, there were actually seven mountain peaks. The last of them seemed high enough to connect Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>The tallest mountains Meng Hao had ever seen in the lands of South Heaven were tens of thousands of meters high. However, even the smallest of these seven mountain peaks were so much grander that the two things could not be compared.</p><br/><p>Cultivators could be seen on the mountains; they looked as small as ants.</p><br/><p>Between each of the seven mountain peaks stretched staircases that connected the countless luxuriously decorated buildings. Innumerable pagodas and temples could be seen. All of it was filled with a deeply archaic atmosphere. It was completely silent, deathly still, as if it was a tomb.</p><br/><p>There was no life.</p><br/><p>This was the image that floated in Meng Hao\u2019s mind, based on his single glance. This was his opportunity.</p><br/><p>Even as he grumbled, the river of stars once again trembled. The trembling caused Meng Hao to suddenly regain some control over his body. His heart filling with joy, Meng Hao used his head to push against the softness in front of him.</p><br/><p>What ended up happening was that his face merely sank further into the softness. However, the softness seemed to have a shocking bounciness, causing the woman to finally move away from him. It was hard to tell whether it was because of the force of Meng Hao\u2019s action, or the shocking bounciness, but\u2026 the woman seemed to frown as if in pain.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao cleared his throat and then quickly looked out at the outside world. Ancient mountains rose and fell. Mountain peaks stretched up loftily. The image of the seven mountains was not very much different than what had existed in his memory. Meng Hao looked out again, and this time, he noticed that there was not a scrap of vegetation in the entire mountain range. They were completely bare, and emanated a strong aura of death that pervaded all of the mountains\u2026.</p><br/><p>Everything was in ruins. Buildings were collapsed. The elegant structures were decrepit. There were no weeds present; clearly, the passage of time ensured that they turned into nothing more than dust, along with all other life.</p><br/><p>The entire place was in complete ruins. The ruins of a Sect!</p><br/><p>The sight of it caused Meng Hao to take a deep breath. It took some effort, but he managed to lift his head, whereupon he noticed that, carved onto the first mountain were three characters!</p><br/><p>These three characters were red, as if they had literally been painted with blood.</p><br/><p>Demon Immortal Sect!</p><br/><p>The moment Meng Hao saw those characters, his heart and mind trembled. Although he had long since speculated regarding the final destination, he could now be certain\u2026. This place was the Demon Immortal Sect. Or, more accurately speaking\u2026 the ancient Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>And this place was naturally the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane!</p><br/><p>A whole Sect. An entire world!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the Sect had been completely destroyed. This once majestic Sect of the Ninth Mountain and Sea had long since disappeared into the river of history, a Sect that at one time had been occupied by more than a million disciples!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao began to pant as he noticed that atop the first mountain peak could be seen the corpse of a Flying Rain-Dragon. However, this dragon was far, far bigger than the one he had seen back in the Reliance Sect. It was nearly ten thousand meters in length, and was incomparably shocking in appearance.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had a special affinity for Flying Rain-Dragons. As he looked at this one, he felt somewhat at a loss for a moment before recovering and looking at the second mountain peak.</p><br/><p>When he looked at the second peak, his mind trembled, and he once again began to breathe heavily. Earlier when he had glanced over the mountain peaks, he hadn\u2019t studied them carefully. Now, he noticed that there was an enormous corpse on this mountain as well.</p><br/><p>This corpse was human-shaped. However, its frame was enormous, and on its back\u2026 were wings!!</p><br/><p>It was impossible to see what color the wings were, because the corpse was directly facing Meng Hao. The facial features of the corpse were not clear. However, in that instant, the image of the Black Bat suddenly rose up in Meng Hao\u2019s mind!</p><br/><p>On the third mountain peak were three corpses, which for some reason seemed familiar to Meng Hao. Suddenly, his mind reeled. These corpses were half human and half beast, and looked exactly like the creature he had taken the third wooden sword from in the Golden Crow Holy Land!</p><br/><p>On the fourth mountain peak was\u2026 an enormous dragon, fully thirty thousand meters long!</p><br/><p>The dragon was nothing more than a corpse, but it was still thoroughly shocking.</p><br/><p>Dragons were legendary creatures, even in the Cultivation world. Meng Hao had seen them in the form of magical techniques or divine abilities. However, as for an actual dragon, he had never seen one with his own eyes.</p><br/><p>The fifth mountain peak was quite a distance away from Meng Hao, so he couldn\u2019t clearly see the corpse which lay atop it. However, the shock he felt even from just seeing the first four mountains was completely and utterly unprecedented.</p><br/><p>He suddenly had the feeling that he had some very strong connections to this Primordial Demon Immortal Plane!</p><br/><p>\u201cThree wooden swords. Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 they all came from here?\u201d Having seen this enormous Demon Immortal Sect, Meng Hao could only imagine how intrepid it must have been in ancient times.</p><br/><p>Even as his heart and mind trembled, his pupils suddenly constricted. That was because\u2026 he had just caught sight of a person on the fourth mountain!</p><br/><p>It was a middle-aged man whose back was turned to Meng Hao. He seemed to be filled with infinite ancientness, as well as deep loneliness. Meng Hao was sure that the man was standing there on the peak of the fourth mountain, but when he blinked, the man was gone. This caused Meng Hao\u2019s eyes to glow brightly.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, this once intrepid Demon Immortal Sect, which was now nothing more than ruins, began to grow blurry. It was as if a vast mist had begun to cover over the entire world.</p><br/><p>Even Meng Hao and the river of stars also began to grow blurry. Meng Hao\u2019s heart began to pound.</p><br/><p>He now had the feeling that the most critical point in the journey to the Primordial Demon Immortal Plane had arrived.</p><br/><p>His eyes were fixed on the world up ahead as he rotated his Cultivation base. However, everything was just as blurry as before. Meng Hao clenched his jaw as he then employed the Celestial Vision technique that the parrot had taught him.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he could see!</p><br/><p>What he saw caused his mind to be filled with shock. What existed beyond the blurriness was still the Demon Immortal Sect. However\u2026 it was no longer in ruins, but rather\u2026 bustling with activity!</p><br/><p>Countless figures could be seen flying back and forth within the mountains. There were innumerable Cultivators practicing cultivation on the mountains, and the glow of magical techniques spread out in all directions. In the azure sky, countless elegant Immortal Beasts could be seen flying about.</p><br/><p>The Flying Rain-Dragon on the first peak lifted its head up and roared. It suddenly moved, causing a huge gale-force wind to spring up. However, to this Flying Rain-Dragon, all it had done was stretch its neck.</p><br/><p>When he saw the second mountain peak, Meng Hao had thought of the Black Bat. Sure enough, there was an enormous black-colored bat there now. It was shocking in appearance, and emanated an intense aura. As soon as Meng Hao saw it, he was shaken to the core.</p><br/><p>The entire world, the entire Sect, contained not even a scrap of an aura of death. Everything was bursting with life. Off on the fifth mountain, voices rose and fell, as if sermons were being given regarding scriptures.</p><br/><p>A bridge-like rainbow spanned the sky, glowing radiantly. People sat cross-legged in all locations, listening to scriptures being recited or gaining enlightenment of the Dao.</p><br/><p>These Cultivators all had different appearances. Some were people, but others\u2026 were Demons!</p><br/><p>Even as Meng Hao reeled with shock, he suddenly looked over at the fourth mountain peak. Yet again, he saw the same man, standing with his back toward him. He radiated ancientness, and caused Meng Hao to begin to breathe heavily.</p><br/><p>It seemed almost as if the man could sense Meng Hao looking at him. He slowly turned to look at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t clearly see what the man looked like, but Meng Hao\u2019s brain filled with roaring nonetheless. Suddenly, the world he was looking at began to shatter, layer by layer. It quickly vanished, like smoke into thin air. Instead of the flourishing Sect of ancient times, everything was now wreckage and ruins.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the river of stars flowed toward the ruins of the ancient Demon Immortal Sect. As it swept across the ruins, all of the dust motes spread out and then began to descend down onto the enormous Sect.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was among the falling dots, as were the several dozen Cultivators from the great lands of South Heaven. All of them were scattered into different locations.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao, of course, was the only one among their number who was awake. His mind spun as his body, completely out of his own control, shot down toward the ruins at incredible speed. The mountains in front of him grew larger and larger. An aura of death and rot blasted against his face, and then, he was shooting toward the second mountain peak. A roaring sound could then be heard, and it was in this instant that Meng Hao suddenly regained control of this body. The power of his Cultivation base exploded out, and he lifted up his right hand.</p><br/><p>He landed onto the ground on one knee. Dust shot away from him in all directions, and his hair whipped about. When he looked up, his eyes were gleaming.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
