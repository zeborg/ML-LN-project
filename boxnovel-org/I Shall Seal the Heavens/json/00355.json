Meng Hao blinked. \u201cLooks like even though I saved her, no one will believe I did.\u201d In the lead was a handsome young man who looked extremely nervous. His Cultivation base was at the late Core Formation stage.</p><br/><p>Following him were a dozen or so other Cultivators, the weakest of whom was at the early Core Formation stage. Three were of the same level as the young man, the late Core Formation Stage.</p><br/><p>At the front of their group were five rotating planets; the spell formation shone brightly and caused them to speed forward like the wind as they attacked.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Hanxue Shan shot forward. Her speed was incredible, causing Meng Hao\u2019s eyes to flicker. Clearly, she had been concealing the true limits of her speed before. As she flew forward, a cloud of ice and snow appeared beneath her feet, propelling her forward. The other two Cultivators also shot forward, utilizing magical techniques and treasures to increase their speed.</p><br/><p>They were obviously worried that Meng Hao would attack them, or do something else to hold them back. Apparently, their use of these techniques and items were a waste; Meng Hao did nothing more than watch them go, a faint, enigmatic smile on his face. He didn\u2019t even take half a step forward; he just let them speed away.</p><br/><p>This caused the two Cultivators to stare in shock. However, they had no time to think much about it; as vigilant as ever, they escorted Hanxue Shan as she flew down toward the battlefield, ready to defend her with their lives. As Hanxue Shan flew along, a silvery glow flew out from her person. Wherever the silver light went, the surrounding beasts would stop moving and being to tremble. This made it possible for them to quickly charge quite a distance.</p><br/><p>When Hanxue Shan and her guards were several hundred meters away from Meng Hao, he saw them meet up with the other young Cultivator and his group. Both seemed quite excited, but obviously knew that this was not the time for any sort of discussion. The Cultivators from the young man\u2019s group fanned out to protect Hanxue Shan, and they headed back toward the city.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that Hanxue Shan finally breathed a sigh of relief. She glanced back at Meng Hao off in the distance, a cunning, complacent gleam in her eyes.</p><br/><p>However, just as the group set out, Flood Dragons, Black Lands Cultivators, as well as a huge group of black wolves, charged toward them in attack. Off in the distance were some Western Desert Cultivators who also approached, eight of them. The battlefield was in chaos, but Meng Hao was clearly able to see all of these developments.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think I\u2019ll forget so easily about the fact that I saved your life,\u201d murmured Meng Hao. By this time, even he could see that this was not any sort of decisive battle. Both sides had various misgivings and were holding back.</p><br/><p>The most powerful combatant on the field was the Nascent Soul Cultivator from the Black Lands Palace, who hadn\u2019t even made an attack. The person who had been sent to escort Hanxue Shan was of the late Core Formation stage. Holy Snow City hadn\u2019t even deployed Nascent Soul Cultivators at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re holding back,\u201d thought Meng Hao, scanning the battlefield. \u201cNeither side wants to reveal their true strength. This battle is just a way to feel each other out. I don\u2019t see much down there that could cause any problems for me.\u201d He began to stride forward, followed by the confused Western Desert Cultivator.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a flash of light appeared within Holy Snow City, a figure who shot out past the city walls. It was an old woman with gray hair. The silver-masked Nascent Soul Cultivator from the Black Lands Palace strode forward to meet her, his eyes gleaming. Neither spoke; instead, they immediately attacked with divine abilities.</p><br/><p>A boom echoed out, and the sky above the battlefield suddenly grew dim.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the slaughtering on the battlefield grew more intense. More Cultivators poured out of Holy Snow City to join the fighting.</p><br/><p>As for Hanxue Shan, she was getting more nervous. Despite being surrounded by guards from Holy Snow City, she was still quite some distance from the city itself. Furthermore, the surrounding wolves, lions, Flood Dragons and Cultivators from the Black Lands Palace and Western Desert, were making it difficult to move at all. Out of their group of a dozen or so Holy Snow City Cultivators, three had already died.</p><br/><p>The magical Five Planets device rotated rapidly, but even the bright beams of white light that shot out from it were incapable of completely extricating them from the danger they were in. Even more importantly, one of the enormous giants was approaching, brandishing its gigantic sword. In addition, a group of more than a dozen Flood Dragons was currently charging toward the Five Planets, clearly intent on destroying them.</p><br/><p>If the magical Five Planets device was destroyed, then they would be in even more danger.</p><br/><p>A roaring sound filled the air as the dozen or so Flood Dragons began to howl. Their bodies glowed with flickering light as they shot toward the Five Planets device. Booming sounds filled the air as it began to break apart. Moments later, it completely collapsed.</p><br/><p>When the Five Planets device broke apart, four more of the Cultivators surrounding Hanxue Shan died. When she heard their agonized, dying screams, her face went pale. She watched as one of the Cultivators chose to self-detonate before being killed. The powerful explosion spread out, slamming into their enemies, buying them a bit more time.</p><br/><p>The young man of the late Core Formation stage anxiously grabbed Hanxue Shan, his eyes bloodshot as he dragged her onward toward the city. He seemed worried that the nearby beasts and Cultivators might also use self-detonation.</p><br/><p>The complacency Hanxue Shan had previously shown toward Meng Hao was now completely gone, replaced instead by grief. She could only bite her lip as she followed the young man in front of her.</p><br/><p>It was at this time that Meng Hao entered the battlefield. Before he had moved too far, nearby black wolves charged toward him, radiating frenzied savagery. Meng Hao\u2019s right hand shot out and grabbed one of them by the neck. Using his left hand, he forced a medicinal pill into its mouth, which caused it to begin to shake violently. Suddenly, the fur began to fall off of its body, which then began to swell. This entire process only took the space of a few breaths. As other wolves closed in, Meng Hao let go.</p><br/><p>A boom filled the air as the hairless wolf let out a miserable shriek, and then exploded. There was no flesh and blood, but rather a black mist that spread out in all directions. As soon as the incoming wolves touched the mist, their bodies began to wither up, and they let out miserable shrieks as their bodies, too, transformed into mist. Very quickly, the area surrounding Meng Hao was filled with thick mist.</p><br/><p>He proceeded forward, his expression as calm as usual. Of course, the scene which had just played out would cause any observer\u2019s eyes to fill with astonishment.</p><br/><p>As he walked on, the mist roiled out, killing any of the beasts who touched it. It didn\u2019t take long before he was surrounded by mist for dozens of meters in each direction. By now, many people on the battlefield were looking over in his direction.</p><br/><p>Hanxue Shan also saw what was happening. It was at this moment that a huge blue lion, over twenty meters long, pounced toward Meng Hao. Before it could get close, though, Meng Hao\u2019s right hand stretched out as fast as lightning, clamping onto the neck of the lion. Once again, he used his left hand to force a medicinal pill into its mouth.</p><br/><p>Everyone watched on in astonishment as the gigantic lion\u2019s fur suddenly began to fall off. After that, it exploded, not into flesh and blood, but rather, a blue mist.</p><br/><p>The blue mist spread out in the cold air, rapidly fusing with the black mist. The new mist expanded, and now, Meng Hao had no need to personally attack any of the blue lions. As soon as they touched the mist, their bloodcurdling howls would echo across the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Gasps could be heard from the nearby Black Lands Palace Cultivators.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 poison? That guy\u2019s a poison expert!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no ordinary poison. Look what it does to the Western Desert neo-demons! This poison\u2026 it\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Black Lands Palace Cultivators backed up, the faces beneath their masks filled with shock. Considering that even the Western Desert Cultivators\u2019 Demonic beasts had no way to avoid Meng Hao\u2019s poison, how could they?</p><br/><p>Even more shocked than them were the Western Desert Cultivators, who all looked at Meng Hao with gazes of astonishment and terror.</p><br/><p>Among the Western Desert forces were three people who were clearly not as tall as the others but were still sported totem tattoos. These were Western Desert Dragoneers, men capable of controlling neo-demons.</p><br/><p>All of the Flood Dragons, black wolves and lions in the area were under their control. However, they seemed more frightened than anyone else on the battlefield. Their breathing came in ragged pants as they stared at the mist surrounding Meng Hao; their hearts were filled with astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cDragoneer! He\u2019s a Dragoneer\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly a Dragoneer could understand neo-demons so well to be able to kill them like that\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao proceeded onward. Up above, fierce shrieks rang out as three Flood Dragons sped toward him. Meng Hao looked up, a strange light glowing in his eyes. There was no need to use poison in this situation. All he did was open his mouth in the direction of the Flood Dragons and suck in a deep breath.</p><br/><p>As he did, the Flying Rain-Dragon Core that existed inside of his Golden Core suddenly trembled. Suddenly, the illusory image of a massive Flying Rain-Dragon appeared behind Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>It was huge, several hundred meters in length, and it erupted with a domineering air of profound superiority. It was a sovereign of the sky! As Meng Hao breathed in, the Flying Rain-Dragon opened its mouth and charged toward the Flood Dragons. It seemed to be hungry, starving, as if it hadn\u2019t eaten for tens of thousands of years.</p><br/><p>The three Flood Dragons let out miserable, desperate shrieks. Now that they faced up against a Flying Rain-Dragon, they trembled, and their expressions were those of dread. They wanted to flee, but it was too late.</p><br/><p>The Flying Rain-Dragon swallowed them up, a scene which caused everyone on the battlefield to reel. The Western Desert Cultivators stared with wide eyes, panting, their faces covered with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 he consumed those neo-demons!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand Dragoneer! He\u2019s definitely a Grand Dragoneer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Flying Rain-Dragon phantom is his Heavenly neo-demon! It\u2019s definitely a Heavenly neo-demon! The Heavenly neo-demon of a Grand Dragoneer!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Black Lands Palace Cultivators, the Holy Snow City Cultivators, everyone was staring at the scene, their minds reeling. The Flying Rain-Dragon behind Meng Hao lifted its head toward the sky in a soundless roar, then shot toward more Flood Dragons.</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Daniel Han, Mykola Sakharov, Nam Tran, Nightrunners, Dion Schut, Hanry Chandra, Pedro Pulido, Alexander Kubiak, and Lim Derek</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}
