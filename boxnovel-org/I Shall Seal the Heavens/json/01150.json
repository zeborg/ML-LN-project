Those things caused the light of the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao to grow unstable. It was being interfered with, including by the powerful Door of Immortality. As a result, the power of expulsion coming from the pillar of light temporarily ceased.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao used that moment to finally reach his hand out and sink it into the pillar of light that was the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao. Almost as soon as his hand entered the light, Paragon Sea Dream\u2019s convergence beam grew a bit stronger.</p><br/><p>The intensity was something that no observer would be able to detect, but Meng Hao could feel it, and it caused his eyes to flicker, although he didn\u2019t say anything out loud.</p><br/><p>The light pulling at him grew more intense. However, it was in that same moment that, because of the effects of the arrow, Meng Hao had a moment to finally stretch out and touch the pillar of light in front of him!</p><br/><p>\u201cTraitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao, you belong to me!\u201d he roared, his eyes shining with a bright light as he plunged his hand into the pillar of light.</p><br/><p>Shocking rumbling filled the air and everything was shaking. In response to what was happening, the figures inside the black hole began to let out enraged shouts.</p><br/><p>\u201cNO!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t belong to you! Dammit! Let go!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat belongs to the 33 Heavens!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Each and every one of the furious shouts rumbled like thunder, causing Meng Hao to shake, and blood to spray out of his mouth. Despite the rage of the figures inside the black hole, none of them dared to emerge from inside. What had happened moments ago with the arrow had frightened any and all courage out of them!</p><br/><p>All they could do was use their roars of fury to batter Meng Hao. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, but he was in the Allheaven Dao Immortal Realm, and thus, he fought back. His hand didn\u2019t stop moving, and as soon as it entered the pillar of light, he made a grasping motion as he took hold of the actual Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao.</p><br/><p>In that moment, the blood in his body began to boil even more furiously, as though there were something inside of it that was awakening. Rumbling sounds completely filled Meng Hao\u2019s entire mind.</p><br/><p>His body roared as the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao was absorbed into him through his right hand.</p><br/><p>As that happened, the pillar of light began to weaken. At the same time, the blood inside of him was completely aboil. Cracking sounds echoed about inside of him, like peals of thunder.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, an ancient voice rang out, filled with boundless dignity, a voice that seemed to have existed within Meng Hao\u2019s blood itself all along. However, it was only in this moment, because of the absorption of the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao, that the voice began to speak. It was as if its words echoed out from the most ancient of times to appear in the modern age.</p><br/><p>\u201cNine ancient surnames; The source of the primeval; Lords of the majestic expanse; The boundless Heaven and Earth... in this era... of the Nine Allheaven Clans, the Fang Clan has taken the lead and tracked down their Essence. In all members of that bloodline, Nirvanic Rebirth exists, and the chakras are opened!\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost in the same moment that the voice rang out inside Meng Hao\u2019s mind, all of the blood in his body seemed to break down. The Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao then merged into each and every blood cell inside of him, ensuring that every drop of blood thrummed with the same bloodline power!</p><br/><p>In that exact same moment, back in the Mountain and Sea Realm, in the Ninth Mountain and Sea, on Planet South Heaven, Meng Hao's father was currently sitting cross-legged in a Tower of Tang, carrying out his pledge and mission of standing guard over Planet South Heaven.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a tremor ran through him, and his eyes snapped open. A gleam of shock and confusion ran through him as the blood in his veins apparently began to burn. Gradually, an azure light began to rise up from within him. That azure light was none other than... the light of an Allheaven Immortal!!</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out in all directions. Fang Xiufeng\u2019s cultivation base was at the peak of the Ancient Realm, and as of this moment, it was erupting with power. Heaven and Earth flashed with colors, but after a moment, everything settled down. He did not make a cultivation base breakthrough. However, inside of his body, an azure-colored Dao seed had appeared!</p><br/><p>That Dao seed was none other than an Allheaven Dao seed. If he cultivated it, then he would be able to tread the Allheaven path, and would eventually become an Allheaven Immortal!</p><br/><p>Fang Xiufeng\u2019s eyes opened again, his heart trembled, and his face flickered. He was still a bit confused, and couldn't figure out exactly what was happening.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one experiencing such a thing. In the Emperor Immortal Sect, Meng Hao\u2019s sister Fang Yu was currently sitting in secluded meditation. Suddenly, azure light began to glow as an Allheaven Dao seed formed inside of her!</p><br/><p>A shockwave blasted out, causing the bald Sun Hai, who was just outside her secluded meditation chamber jabbering on about his love for her, to let out a surprised shout. He was hit as if with a powerful attack, sending him tumbling away, blood spraying from his mouth.</p><br/><p>In the Fang Clan on Planet East Victory, everyone with Fang Clan blood in their veins all experienced something similar, causing the glow of azure light to fill Planet East Victory. Fang Wei was surrounded by an azure glow, as was the Grand Elder. The Fang Clan\u2019s Dao Realm Patriarchs, and all other members of the Fang Clan, experienced an intangible transformation. It was just as the voice in Meng Hao's mind had said. Because of the Nirvanic Rebirth, the chakras were opened!</p><br/><p>The Fang Clan was the first Allheaven Clan!</p><br/><p>Wind screamed through the entire Nine Mountains and Seas. As of this moment, the matter was set... the Fang Clan was certain to rise to prominence. With enough time, they would even be able to rock Lord Ji. Furthermore, if even more time passed, the voice of the Fang Clan would become the most supreme in the entire Ninth Mountain and Sea, and they would absolutely become the most important clan.</p><br/><p>That was because, the Fang Clan was now... an Allheaven Clan!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Meng Hao was there in the Windswept Realm, rumbling sounds emanating out from him. The third Nirvana Fruit in his forehead did not emerge from within him. Instead, it was madly absorbing the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao and fusing it into Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>He was shaking violently, filled with so much force that it seemed like he might explode. Simultaneously, the entire Fang Clan was changing. However, unlike all the other members of the Fang Clan, Meng Hao was not forming an Allheaven Dao seed.</p><br/><p>He... had no Dao seed!</p><br/><p>That was because the bloodline had been opened due to him. The chakras had been unleashed because of his name. As of this moment, from a bloodline perspective, Meng Hao had exceeded the first generation Patriarch!</p><br/><p>He was now the one true patriarch of the Allheaven Fang Clan!</p><br/><p>Perhaps his cultivation base wasn\u2019t high enough at the moment, and he didn\u2019t have sufficient status. However, because of the strength of his bloodline... he was the Patriarch!</p><br/><p>The bloodlines of everyone in the Fang Clan had been awakened because of Meng Hao. Furthermore, all members of the Fang Clan now had Allheaven Dao seeds inside of them. Essentially, that was because of the influence of Meng Hao\u2019s blood. He was the source of it all!</p><br/><p>Furthermore... Meng Hao could even sense the blood of all members of the Fang Clan in the Mountain and Sea Realm.</p><br/><p>Even more shocking was that, the best way to prove that he really was the Patriarch of the Fang Clan, was that he could actually control the life or death of all members of the Fang Clan!</p><br/><p>He could kill any member of the Fang Clan with a single thought. His will reigned supreme over everything. That was a power that came from being an Allheaven Dao Immortal, as well as the Clan Chief of an Allheaven Clan. He had the ultimate power of life and death!</p><br/><p>All of this takes quite some time to describe, but occurred in a very short period of time. It took only an instant for the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao to be absorbed and then fade away, having been completely sucked into Meng Hao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>The Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao was now a part of Meng Hao, a key which had unlocked his bloodline and then disseminated that power to all members of the Fang Clan, allowing them to acquire Dao seeds.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao allowed him to absorb his third Nirvana Fruit, a fusion which was completely different from what had happened with his previous two Nirvana Fruits. Furthermore, the fusion process would take time.</p><br/><p>It could take several months for Meng Hao to fully and truly... be an Allheaven Dao Immortal!</p><br/><p>In the Mountain and Sea Realm, he would be the one and only... Allheaven Dao Immortal!</p><br/><p>He would be a powerful expert on a similar level as Quasi-Dao cultivators. He could even fight with Dao Realm experts. From ancient times until now, that was the ultimate peak of the Immortal Realm!</p><br/><p>In the moment that the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao vanished, Meng Hao fell back. Paragon Sea Dream\u2019s convergence beam pulled at him, wrenching him backward. As he turned his head, he could see that everyone else had long since left the Windswept Realm.</p><br/><p>Even Chu Yuyan had been pulled away by Paragon Sea Dream.</p><br/><p>When he saw Chu Yuyan off in the distance, his heart filled with conflicted emotions. Without the help of Dao-Heaven and the other Echelon cultivators, as well as Chu Yuyan\u2019s Door of Immortality, he would never have come even close to getting the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao.</p><br/><p>His feelings for Chu Yuyan grew even more complicated, and he sighed.</p><br/><p>Of all the people from the Mountain and Sea Realm, Meng Hao was the last to leave the Windswept Realm. Just as he was about to leave it completely, he looked back at the soul of the Emperor, and saw him smiling faintly. It was almost as if he didn\u2019t care that Meng Hao had taken the Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao.</p><br/><p>Then he saw the Windswept Imperial Lord, who had a complicated expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Finally, he looked at Zong Wuya, standing there in the central temple region. Zong Wuya was looking up at him, an expression of anticipation on his face. Meng Hao could also sense his focus, as if Zong Wuya could almost feel himself experiencing the true Dao.</p><br/><p>The black hole in the huge net had long since opened up fully. Despite the fact that there was no Traitorous Sutra of the Rebel Dao, the Windswept Realm\u2019s path was not hindered. If anything... the mere existence of the Sutra guaranteed that the Windswept Realm would have a place outside the Mountain and Sea Realm, regardless of whether or not Meng Hao took it.</p><br/><p>Now that the Windswept Realm was gone, perhaps it would become the 34th Heaven, and perhaps not. It was really impossible to tell at this point.</p><br/><p>In any case, to the living beings of the Windswept Realm, this counted as a success. They had finally... escaped the Mountain and Sea Realm!</p><br/><p>Boundless rumbling sounds echoed out into the void as Meng Hao flew over the border. Then he watched as the lands were slowly swallowed up into the black hole.</p><br/><p>Thunder and wind raged, and then the black hole gradually began to shrink. It disappeared, and the huge net began to fade away amidst crackling thunder and lightning. At that point, Meng Hao could just barely see numerous figures on the other side of the net. All of them stared at him, as well as at Paragon Sea Dream. After a moment, they vanished.</p><br/><p>Soon, the huge net was gone, and the only thing visible... was pitch black.</p><br/><p>The Windswept Realm was gone....</p><br/><p>As for whether or not Zong Wuya would find the true Dao that he was looking for, Meng Hao had no way to know. However, he was very certain that one day, he would personally visit each and every world in the 33 Heavens!</p><br/><p><strong>Chapter 1150: Allheaven Fang Clan!</strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}
