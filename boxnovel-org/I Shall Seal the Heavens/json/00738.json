The third time was because of a combined attack from the early Dao Seeking expert from the Solitary Sword Sect, the Golden Frost Sect puppet, and tens of thousands of cultivators.</p><br/><p>Despite all of this, he refused to budge, nor did he allow anyone to enter through the gap.</p><br/><p>When the Blood Demon Sect disciples behind the shield saw his body on the verge of collapse, blood smeared on his skin and soaking his clothes, their eyes went red. There were even some from the group of 30,000 survivors from the first spell formation who leaped up and began to charge toward the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood Prince!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood Prince, we will fight with you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, even as they charged forward, Meng Hao waved his sleeve behind him, causing a powerful wind to rise up and carry them back behind the safety of the shield.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you, stay back!\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked back, and determination could be seen in his eyes. It was a look that said, This is my fight. To Meng Hao, this was the only option that could leave him with a clear conscience. Besides, his body was difficult to destroy, which could not be said of the others.</p><br/><p>BOOOOMMMMM!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao fell back, a ferocious expression on his face. By this time, multiple Blood Demon Grand Magic vortexes had appeared in the area, nine in total. Each and every one was gold in color, and unleashed boundless gravitational force.</p><br/><p>The cultivators who found themselves trapped in the vortexes could only watch in shock as their bodies withered rapidly, and their cultivation bases were sucked out.</p><br/><p>Massive quantities of qi and blood flowed toward Meng Hao, which he absorbed, causing his fleshly body to grow powerful to an incredible degree. His cultivation base also climbed higher, making him\u2026 even harder to destroy.</p><br/><p>A strange glow appeared in his eyes. He would not let anyone into the gap in the shield behind him, not even\u2026 over his dead body!</p><br/><p>BOOM!!</p><br/><p>Even with the vast quantity of qi, blood, and cultivation base power that were replenishing him, he was facing up against assaults from hundreds of thousands of enemies. There were also many powerful experts amongst them. Blood sprayed from his mouth, and his body once again exploded into a cloud of blood and gore.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, however, it seemed that the cloud underwent a reversal of time and coalesced back into the form of Meng Hao. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes were bloodshot as he roared and yet again unleashed the Blood Demon Grand Magic.</p><br/><p>The Ninth Mountain appeared up ahead, and descended with massive rumblings. Along with the Time Sword Formation, it swept across the battlefield madly. The Blood Mastiff was not faring well, and didn\u2019t seem capable of holding out much longer. However, with Meng Hao there, it would continue to fight.</p><br/><p>But would Meng Hao really allow the Blood Mastiff to face such danger? He waved his right hand, causing the Blood Mastiff to return to the blood-colored mask. Then, he performed an incantation gesture, and a tenth Blood Demon Grand Magic vortex appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can hold on with the Blood Demon Grand Magic, then there\u2019s the possibility that the vortex will reach a certain point that it can sustain my defense of this position indefinitely!\u201d As he gritted his teeth, Resurrection Lily tentacles shot out from behind him, creating a dense barrier in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking to die?!\u201d someone said, along with a cold snort. Three old Spirit Severing cultivators appeared, standing on glowing halos that appeared to be a spell formation. They immediately shot toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Behind them were tens of thousands of cultivators wielding countless varieties of divine abilities. If Meng Hao had faced any of these magics by themselves, he could just ignore them. However, their overwhelming numbers caused the sky to dim and the land to quake.</p><br/><p>It was like a massive flood filled of murderous hate, surging down onto Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The three Spirit Severing cultivators closed in, and Meng Hao\u2019s killing intent flickered as he realized that these three were experts from the Li Clan. He performed an incantation with his left hand, and Blood Immortal divine abilities appeared. Rumbling filled the air as they fused with the Resurrection Lily. A blood-red flower shot out to defend against the incoming flood.</p><br/><p>Massive explosions boomed out as Meng Hao unleashed all his magic against the torrent of enemies. Unfortunately, he could only hold them back temporarily. Soon, they burst through, and the three Spirit Severing cultivators bore down on Meng Hao, roaring. As they neared, the halos beneath their feet shot out ghost images that closed in on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, the ghost images of the three halos began to emanate brilliant glows, as well as shocking, explosive sealing power. They descended onto Meng Hao, preparing to seal him away.</p><br/><p>It was at this exact same moment that six more people flew out from the crowds.</p><br/><p>Of the six, three were from the Solitary Sword Sect and three were from the Golden Frost Sect. The air around them distorted as they unleashed their most powerful, shocking magical techniques.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nine incredible Spirit Severing cultivators all attacked with full force. Furthermore, not far behind them was the Solitary Sword Sect\u2019s early Dao Seeking expert, and the Golden Frost Sect\u2019s puppet. They glared at Meng Hao like tigers eyeing a prey. They didn\u2019t need to personally attack right now; once Meng Hao was either dead or sealed in place, they could enter the gap in the shield and then begin to carry out their slaughter.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t even necessary to keep Meng Hao sealed for a long period of time. A few short breaths of time was all they needed.</p><br/><p>The Blood Demon Sect disciples in the shield could see that a perilous situation was developing, and their anxiety grew. Li Shiqi looked at Meng Hao\u2019s silhouette in the outside world and bit her lip, her expression one of worry.</p><br/><p>Wang Youcai sat quietly, but killing intent burned hotter and hotter in his eyes. He hated the fact that his cultivation base was insufficient, and that he did not possess enough latent talent to be Chosen.</p><br/><p>Xu Qing gazed at Meng Hao in silence, her eyes filled with an affection that seemed like it might be able to melt the world away. Meng Hao's current state caused her heart to ache with distress.</p><br/><p>The six Spirit Severing Patriarchs of the Blood Demon Sect, as well as the hunchbacked old man from the fifth mountain peak, stared blankly at what was happening, at the Blood Prince that they had initially refused to acknowledge.</p><br/><p>A rumbling suddenly echoed out from the three Li Clan Patriarchs. Meng Hao\u2019s eyes began to glow with a bright light, and he struck out violently with his right hand.</p><br/><p>The blow caused everything to tremble and shake; this was a Dao Seeking blow!</p><br/><p>The three incoming halos trembled and seemed to be on the verge of collapsing. However, they were able to continue on, causing Meng Hao to take a deep breath. The surrounding golden vortexes suddenly shattered. The force of the shattering sucked away any remaining qi and blood from the people trapped inside, all of which then merged into Meng Hao. Finally, he punched out again.</p><br/><p>BANG!</p><br/><p>The three glowing halos were crushed as easily as dry weeds!</p><br/><p>The three Li Clan Patriarchs\u2019 faces fell, and they employed divine abilities to defend themselves. However, blood still sprayed from their mouths, and one of them let out a miserable shriek as his body exploded. Looks of astonishment appeared on the faces of the two that remained, who then clenched their jaws and charged toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE!!\u201d</p><br/><p>By now, the six cultivators from the Solitary Sword Sect and the Golden Frost Sect were closing in on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>At the same time, vast quantities of cultivation base power surged into Meng Hao. He raised his right hand and pointed up to the sky, causing the Ninth Mountain to appear. It immediately spread out to fight back against all eight of the incoming enemies.</p><br/><p>Booms rattled out, and blood oozed out of the corners of Meng Hao\u2019s mouth. A ferocious expression filled his face as the illusory Ninth Mountain shook.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow\u2019s our chance!\u201d said the early Dao Seeking cultivator. He and the Golden Frost Sect puppet flew up into the air. At the same time, Meng Hao pointed toward the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Sealing, Eighth Hex!\u201d</p><br/><p>Demonic qi roiled out like strands of silk to entangle the two of them. Although they were able to slough it off in the space of only a single breath, that was all the time Meng Hao needed to unleash a divine ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cNinth Mountain Destruction!\u201d Instantly, the Ninth Mountain that surrounded him exploded. The eight Spirit Severing experts were sent tumbling backward, blood spraying from their mouths. The Solitary Sword Sect early Dao Seeking expert and the Golden Frost Sect puppet were forced to stop in their tracks.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d roared the eight Spirit Severing cultivators. In response, hundreds of thousands of cultivators roared and then began to unleash divine abilities. Shocking booms could be heard as a rain of magic descended onto Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The air distorted around Meng Hao as he stood in place, panting heavily, his cold eyes flickering across the crowds. Currently, he was silhouetted against the brilliant glow of the magical techniques and divine abilities of hundreds of thousands of cultivators. His Eternal stratum once again surged into operation, and he held his ground.</p><br/><p>None shall pass!</p><br/><p>Behind him, the disciples of the Blood Demon Sect looked on with trembling hearts. For the rest of their lives, they would never be able to forget the image of the Blood Prince\u2019s silhouette.</p><br/><p>It was a silhouette like a mountain!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the war was not concluded, and the fighting raged on.</p><br/><p>Time continued to pass in much the same manner. In the blink of an eye, three days had gone by. Now, only seven days remained until Meng Hao\u2019s second true self awakened!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao couldn\u2019t remember exactly how many times his body had fallen to pieces. Were it not for his Eternal stratum, he would long since be dead.</p><br/><p>By now, he could unleash more than fifty golden vortices.</p><br/><p>Terrifying amounts of qi and blood poured into him, as well as cultivation base power. And yet\u2026 it was not enough.</p><br/><p>He trembled, and his eyes were shot with blood. His world was now a world completely the color of blood.</p><br/><p>During those three days, Meng Hao finally came to understand that there was nothing truly Eternal in the world. Even though his body was restored over and over again, the speed with which it occurred was slowing, and he was even beginning to show signs of withering.</p><br/><p>Behind him, the Blood Demon Sect disciples watched with red eyes as their Blood Prince used his own body to block the single gap in the shield. Their hearts felt as if they were being stabbed through with blades. Even someone completely apathetic would be shaken by Meng Hao\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>Even the Patriarchs engaged in battle with Patriarch Blood Demon were moved by the scene unfolding below.</p><br/><p>Finally, after three days of slaughter, silence broke out down below. Of the hundreds of thousands of enemy cultivators, many had died. But their numbers were vast, so the group as a whole didn't really care. The only thing they cared about was that Meng Hao was blocking the gap. He was like a god; with him holding the pass, the entire army was blocked on the other side.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s clothes were soaked in blood, and his expression was one of exhaustion. His eyes were completely shot with blood. To his hundreds of thousands of opponents, he had become like an unforgettable nightmare.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stared out at the hundreds of thousands of cultivators, and they stared back. In truth, by this point, many of them had begun to secretly admire him.</p><br/><p>He was one man, defending one gap. He might have extraordinary divine abilities, and he might have a bizarre fleshly body that could revive itself, but even with that, what he was doing still required courage.</p><br/><p>He was doing something that few other people could do.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they could see that despite the fact that his fleshly body could heal itself, he was showing signs of withering. He was obviously reaching his limit.</p><br/><p>The early Dao Seeking old man from the Solitary Sword Sect looked at him coldly, and killing intent flickered in his eyes. \u201cI haven\u2019t admired very many people in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom today on, you are one of those few!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have some mysterious magic that prevents you from dying, then let\u2019s see how many strikes from our legacy precious treasure you can withstand!</p><br/><p>\u201cRelease the legacy precious treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Anonymous, Martine De Graef, Nicolas Gonzalez Cordero, and Jose Arias</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}
