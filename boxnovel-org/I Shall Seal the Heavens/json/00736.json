The life forces and cultivation bases of 100,000 cultivators poured into the Demonic Incarnation, all of which Meng Hao could sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarly Dao Seeking!\u201d said Meng Hao, sensing the power of the Demonic Incarnation. He waved his hand, and in response, the shrinking, blood-colored shield returned to cover the entire Demonic Incarnation. Without the blood-colored obstructing the way, the six lightning snakes instantly shot toward Meng Hao. So did the Black Sieve Sect discarnate souls and cultivators, who were ashen faced.</p><br/><p>\u201cOffend the Blood Demon Sect? You shall die!\u201d The combined voices of 100,000 people boomed out from the Demonic Incarnation. Heaven and Earth shook, and Meng Hao raised his hand and clenched it into a fist.</p><br/><p>The fist slammed into one of the lightning snakes, which instantly collapsed into pieces. In the blink of an eye, the entire snake fell apart in a huge explosion.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sent the Demonic Incarnation forward. It performed an incantation with its right hand, then gestured forward. Immediately, the air was rent open as a huge fissure appeared. It slashed out and hit another lightning snake, which then exploded.</p><br/><p>All of these things happened with incredible speed. Next, Meng Hao turned the body of the Demonic Incarnation and sent it directly toward the enormous sword formed by the discarnate souls and cultivators of the Black Sieve Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE!!\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s voice joined with the 100,000 cultivators to let out an incredible roar. Their cultivation bases surged, and the power of early Dao Seeking bolstered the noise to transform the roar into a terrifying sound wave.</p><br/><p>The sound wave transformed into visible ripples which then slammed into the Black Sieve Sect discarnate souls and cultivators. One by one, the discarnate souls vanished, as if they were being erased. As for the cultivators with fleshly bodies, they were ripped into pieces by the passing ripple. Tens of thousands of Black Sieve Sect disciples\u2026 all died in body and soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Blood Demon Demonic Incarnation is pretty good!\u201d said the black-robed man from the Solitary Sword Sect, his voice cool. He advanced forward, and was soon directly in front of Meng Hao. Although his hand was clearly empty, a shocking sword qi suddenly materialized and slashed toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>However, before the sword qi could fully descend, a cold snort echoed out from within the Blood Demon Sect. A blood-colored figure flickered into being in front of Meng Hao. It was none other than Patriarch Blood Demon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow meaningless to bully the junior generation!\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to fight? Let\u2019s fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOOMMM!</p><br/><p>Patriarch Blood Demon and the black-robed man from the Solitary Sword Sect immediately rose high up into the air as they began to fight. At the same time, the red-haired old man from the Golden Frost Sect, the 3rd Li Clan Patriarch, and Patriarch Six-Daos flew up. Six-Daos cast a murderous glare at the Demonic Incarnation under Meng Hao\u2019s control, gave a cold snort, then proceeded to completely ignore it as he flew toward Patriarch Blood Demon.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment, though, that three more blood-colored figures shot out from the Blood Demon Sect. Each and every one looked exactly like Patriarch Blood Demon, and each one shot toward one of the three who had just flown out.</p><br/><p>There were now four clones of Patriarch Blood Demon present. Four incredible clones, battling four of the most powerful Patriarchs of the Southern Domain.</p><br/><p>Booms filled the air, and the battle above caused the air to warp and distort. It was difficult for anyone looking on to see clearly, but they could tell that the sky itself seemed on the verge of falling. The intense battle being carried out could clearly shake even the Heavens.</p><br/><p>\u201cKILL THEM!!\u201d Almost in the same moment that the Patriarchs were locked in the decisive battle up above, the rest of the forces of the four great powers charged into battle. Hundreds of thousands of cultivators sped directly toward the Demonic Incarnation controlled by Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Among them was an early Dao Seeking expert from the Solitary Sword Sect, as well as a puppet from the Golden Frost Sect formed by Spirit Severing experts, which also emanated a Dao Seeking aura. The Li Clan had even more spell formations circulating around them. Unfortunately for the Black Sieve Sect, they had sustained severe casualties.</p><br/><p>Killing intent flickered in Meng Hao\u2019s eyes as he brazenly sent the Demonic Incarnation forward to battle directly with the four powers!</p><br/><p>Inside the Demonic Incarnation, the 100,000 Blood Demon Sect disciples\u2019 eyes were bright red. They formed the Blood Demon Sect\u2019s first spell formation, which was not easily destroyed. Were it to be broken, the Blood Demon Sect would then be vulnerable to the outside world.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Demonic Incarnation emanated early Dao Seeking energy as it roared into battle against the hundreds of thousands of cultivators which surrounded it.</p><br/><p>There were only four lightning snakes left, filled with rogue cultivators with bloodshot eyes. They flew through the air, occasionally attacking. As for the Black Sieve Sect, they were in disarray and no longer had enough forces to do battle.</p><br/><p>However, such was not the case with the Solitary Sword Sect. Under the leadership of the early Dao Seeking expert, 100,000 flying swords exploded out, transforming into a shocking power that continuously pelted Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>The early Dao Seeking expert was actually capable of fighting directly with Meng Hao and the Demonic Incarnation. He became the primary force in the battle, backed by the power of ten Solitary Sword Sect Spirit Severing cultivators.</p><br/><p>The Spirit Severing experts of the Golden Frost sect combined to form a puppet, which also emanated a Dao Seeking aura that caused the clouds to seethe when it attacked. They joined forces with the early Dao Seeking cultivator from the Solitary Sword Sect and successfully pinned down Meng Hao and the Demonic Incarnation.</p><br/><p>As for the Li Clan, they were attempting to harm Meng Hao more covertly. They flew around the perimeter, surrounding the area with countless spell formations. Some were used to bind the Demonic Incarnation, others self detonated. Incredible pressure weighed down on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Every time Meng Hao attacked, every time the two sides clashed, many of the cultivators inside the Demonic Incarnation would spit up blood. On one occasion, the Solitary Sect\u2019s early Dao Seeking expert and the Golden Frost Sect Puppet combined their attacks and struck the Demonic Incarnation with an earth-shaking force. 20,000 of the cultivators inside were unable to withstand the force and their bodies immediately exploded.</p><br/><p>Blood oozed out from the Demonic Incarnation, forming a bloody rain that splattered down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>However, the forces of the four great powers were also paying a heavy price.</p><br/><p>Over a three day period, a third of the Golden Frost Sect cultivators died. Twenty percent of the Solitary Sword Sect perished. The Black Sieve Sect was thoroughly crippled, and twenty percent of the Li Clan were dead.</p><br/><p>As for the rogue cultivators, Meng Hao had no time to pay them any heed. Despite that, of the four lightning snakes, one more was destroyed.</p><br/><p>As of this point, the four great powers had suffered over 200,000 casualties!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao persisted with gritted teeth. Were it not for the fact that his right arm possessed Dao Seeking strength, he would not have been able to hold out for this long. He lifted his right hand and punched out, connecting with the Golden Frost Sect puppet up ahead. It tumbled back, seemingly on the verge of complete collapse. However, the early Dao Seeking cultivator from the Solitary Sword Sect suddenly appeared and blocked Meng Hao with a flick of his sleeve.</p><br/><p>Countless spell formations around him detonated, and amidst the booming explosions, 100,000 greatswords stabbed into Meng Hao\u2019s Demonic Incarnation.</p><br/><p>\u201cPiss off!\u201d roared Meng Hao, his voice hoarse. The Demonic Incarnation collided with the Golden Frost Sect. Everywhere he passed, he left in his wake the shattered remains of countless puppets formed from the Golden Frost Sect cultivators.</p><br/><p>\u201cSolitary Sword Formation!\u201d Bright gleams appeared in the eyes of the Solitary Sword Sect disciples. All of them began to perform incantations, then gripped their swords tightly as their bodies began to shine intensely, as if they were swords glinting in the light. Each and every person seemed to transform into a sword that flew up into the air. Shockingly, the swords began to interweave into an enormous sword formation!</p><br/><p>The sword formation swirled in mid-air, forming into the shape of a gigantic greatsword that slashed down toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack White Pearls! Ninth Mountain!\u201d Meng Hao waved his left hand, and the Ninth Mountain smashed into the greatsword. The mountain trembled and then collapsed, but so did the Solitary Sword Formation!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao sent the Demonic Incarnation into retreat. Of the remaining 80,000 cultivators inside, 10,000 were once again unable to withstand the force of the blow, and exploded. At the same time, the Solitary Sword Sect\u2019s early Dao Seeking expert suddenly appeared. His hand flashed in an incantation gesture, and an amorphous green fog appeared, within which was a poisonous thorn. He pointed out, causing the green fog to envelop the Demonic Incarnation.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, the poisonous thorn shot forward to stab directly into the Demonic Incarnation. As it passed through, bloodcurdling screams rang out in Meng Hao\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao clenched his right hand into a fist and instantly punched out. The early Dao Seeking expert frowned, then gave a cold snort and performed another incantation. Rumbling could be heard as his body vanished, then reappeared three thousand meters away. His face was a bit pale; clearly, despite have avoided the fist, he had still suffered injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, attack!\u201d he cried. As his voice rang out, he pointed up into the sky. \u201cBamboo sword!\u201d</p><br/><p>A green streak of light shot out of his finger, which then transformed into a tiny, bamboo shoot. It rapidly grew larger, transforming into a bamboo stalk. The stalk then shed its leaves and became a bamboo sword!</p><br/><p>There were some experienced cultivators in the surrounding groups who began to cry out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Solitary Sword Sect\u2019s precious treasure!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard of this precious treasure!\u201d</p><br/><p>The most powerful of the Golden Frost Sect\u2019s puppets let out a cold snort, then made an incantation gesture with its right hand. It stretched its right hand out and made a grasping motion, whereupon a hand-sized piece of rock flew out. It grew rapidly, transforming into a 3,000-meter tall mountain.</p><br/><p>It was pitch black, except for one golden character on the side.</p><br/><p>Termination!</p><br/><p>Mount Termination!</p><br/><p>This was the precious treasure of the Golden Frost Sect, as famous in name as the bamboo sword of the Solitary Sword Sect!</p><br/><p>The 5th Li Clan Patriarch, who had a cultivation base at the great circle of the Third Severing, had been flitting about activating spell formations. When he saw the latest developments, he produced a pink Feng Shui compass and then pushed down onto its surface.</p><br/><p>Immediately, the ground began to rumble, and multiple columns of pink light shot up into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDIE!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Solitary Sword Sect\u2019s bamboo sword seemed to split the heavens, transforming into a green beam of light that shot toward Meng Hao. The Golden Frost Sect\u2019s Mount Termination began to rotate, emitting crushing pressure as it joined the green beam of light to attack Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face fell, and the Black White Pearls and Ninth Mountain appeared again. He waved his right hand, and summoned the full power of his cultivation base to strike out with the most powerful blow he could muster.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The Demonic Incarnation fell back. Green light flashed as a huge wound was opened up. The Demonic Incarnation\u2019s right arm was lopped off; it transformed into 10,000 cultivators in mid-air, and as soon as they appeared, a massive power swept over them and ripped them into pieces.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Mount Termination crushed down, and Meng Hao coughed up blood. A multitude of cracks appeared on the Demonic Incarnation, which then rapidly began to spread out. Soon, numerous cross-legged Blood Demon Sect disciples became visible, expressions of hopelessness covering their faces.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The final salvo came from the spell formation formed from the pink beams of light. Everything rumbled as the light transformed the land into a world of pink. The light beams then shrank down into the form of an enormous pink talon, which slashed out at Meng Hao\u2019s Demonic Incarnation.</p><br/><p>The Demonic Incarnation was incapable of holding out any longer. It appeared to be on the verge of collapse, and many of the cultivators inside died. Currently, only 30,000 remained alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetreat!\u201d Meng Hao shouted. \u201cBack to the sect!\u201d A tremor ran through the Demonic Incarnation as the 30,000 cultivators were ejected from its back.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was the last to retreat. As soon as he left, his right hand flickered in an incantation gesture and then pointed at the almost-shattered Demonic Incarnation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDetonate!!\u201d</p><br/><p>------</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Anonymous, Anonymous, Michael Harrison and LB</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}
