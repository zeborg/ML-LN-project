Its voice echoed out throughout the entire Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled indifferently, apparently not concerned at all. Success or failure didn\u2019t matter, as long as he got to try. What was the point of asking any questions? After all, he had eternal qualifications to participate in this legacy trial by fire.</p><br/><p>This time he didn\u2019t succeed, but the next time, a few hundred years from now\u2026 who was to say that he would fail again?</p><br/><p>Most importantly, he had discovered his path to Spirit Severing. Meng Hao was sure that by shrinking his Cultivation base, by combining everything into one, Spirit Severing would be right in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour path to Spirit Severing has opened,\u201d said Ke Jiusi to Meng Hao, his voice low. \u201cWhen your Cultivation base is completely consolidated, then you can transform it into a Severing blade. You\u2019ll either live, and sever out your Domain, or die, and sever your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao nodded. He had already come to understand this. That was definitely his path to Spirit Severing. Grind and polish his Cultivation base down until it became an illusory blade. After that blade appeared, he could begin the Severing.</p><br/><p>The difference between life and death all lay in that blade!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Cultivators cultivate is both life and death,\u201d said Meng Hao. \u201cI\u2019ve walked such a path for a long time. Living or dying doesn\u2019t really matter. Life\u2019s a journey; the places you go, the things you see, those are the most important things. Live without regrets.\u201d He laughed, his eyes shining brightly.</p><br/><p>A look of admiration appeared in Ke Jiusi\u2019s eyes, and he also laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve already found your path,\u201d he said. With that, he waved his arm, causing a green wind to spring up. It picked up Meng Hao and began to carry him out of the Demon Immortal Sect. \u201cTime to leave. When father gave his approval of you, you became my little brother. I, too, was moved by your Dao. Perhaps one day in the future, the two of us will meet again in the starry sky!</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that when that day arrives, you will have already reached Immortal Ascension!\u201d Even as Ke Jiusi\u2019s voice echoed about, Meng Hao was carried by the green wind far away from the Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ke Jiusi's gaze came to fall upon Zhixiang, who still stood off in the distance.</p><br/><p>Zhixiang immediately clasped hands and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Zhou Zhixiang of the younger generation of the Demon Immortal Sect. Greetings, Patriarch Ke.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll be old friends from now on,\u201d said Ke Jiusi. \u201cDemon Immortal Body\u2026. With people like you, I can feel good about the Demon Immortal Sect.\u201d As he looked at her, his eyes seemed to fill with reminiscence. It was impossible to tell who he was thinking about, but he sighed and then waved a sleeve. A jade slip flew out toward Zhixiang, which she quickly grabbed. Then, the green wind picked her up and, along with Meng Hao, she began to be carried away.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlace that object in your Sect\u2019s Ancestral Hall,\u201d said Ke Jiusi coolly, \u201cand have the disciples prostrate to it. It can stave off extermination for ten thousand years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao and Zhixiang continued to speed away within the green wind.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked back at Ke Jiusi, and couldn\u2019t help but think back to all of the things that had happened since he arrived in the Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeal up the Demon Immortal Sect,\u201d said Ke Jiusi, his voice echoing out. \u201cDestiny has already been severed, now we adjourn for a few centuries....\u201d Meng Hao watched him as he sat down gloomily cross-legged on the fourth of true spirit Night\u2019s horns.</p><br/><p>At the same time, true spirit Night gave Meng Hao a deep look. Then, its enormous head began to sink down. Its eyes slowly closed, and by the time the head sank down completely\u2026 the seven horns rose up above the land!</p><br/><p>Endless amounts of dust flew about. It was almost like time was running in reverse. Everything returned to its original position. In the blink of an eye, the seven horns grew thick and bulky, and were soon seven mountain peaks once again!</p><br/><p>There were corpses on the mountain peaks just like before, not one more or less than before. The restrictive spells were in place just like before. It was like nothing had changed at all. The lands below also returned to how they were before. In moments, everything looked exactly as it had when Meng Hao first arrived.</p><br/><p>Ke Jiusi sat cross-legged atop the Fourth Peak. His back was to Meng Hao; he was facing an area just outside the Seventh Peak, the location of Ke Yunhai\u2019s tomb\u2026.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao felt as if he had just slammed into an invisible wall. As he sank into it, everything went black. When he came to, he was outside the Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>He glanced back, and the Demon Immortal Sect looked hazy. Just barely visible were countless illusory figures, hustling and bustling about.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao said nothing. Zhixiang had emerged along with him, and when she looked back, her expression was one of pain and complex emotions as she looked at the illusory Demon Immortal Sect.</p><br/><p>Countless tiny fragments of rock and stone suddenly flew out to surround Meng Hao and Zhixiang, quickly transforming into a new river of stars. Meng Hao was still gazing at the Demon Immortal Sect when a tremor ran through the whole river of stars, and it began to carry him and Zhixiang away. It rolled out like a bolt of white silk.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao said nothing as the Demon Immortal Sect drew farther and farther away. Zhixiang likewise maintained her silence. They got farther and farther away until soon, the Bridge of Immortal Treading became visible among the stars.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to go,\u201d said Zhixiang suddenly. She looked at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>He turned to look at her. \u201cTake care of yourself on your journey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their eyes met, and Zhixiang gave a warm smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you. My promise to you hasn\u2019t changed. I truly believe that one day in the future, we will meet again. I look forward to finding out where we will meet, under what circumstances, or, perhaps I should say\u2026 in what identity.\u201d Although she smiled, a flicker of farewell could be seen in her eyes.</p><br/><p>With a final deep look at him, Zhixiang slapped her bag of holding. A person flew out from inside. It was a woman, her features beautiful, obviously quite young. This was none other than the Holy Daughter of the Five Poisons Tribe, Zhao Youlan.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were closed, and she wasn\u2019t moving. There were still signs of life detectable, but she was obviously in a state of dormancy. From the ripples of her Cultivation base, it was obvious that she was\u2026 of the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis girl and I are connected by destiny,\u201d said Zhixiang lightly. \u201cI possessed her fleshly body that year, but I didn\u2019t destroy her soul. I promised her that when it was time to part, I would bestow her with the good fortune of a great circle Nascent Soul Cultivation base. [1. Zhixiang made the promise to Zhao Youlan in chapter 474]</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the time I acquired the Demon Immortal Body, I had already returned her body to her. Would you mind taking her back to the lands of South Heaven with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at Zhao Youlan, then back at Zhixiang. He nodded.</p><br/><p>With a final look at Meng Hao, Zhixiang turned and then flew out from the river of stars. As she emerged out into the starry sky, a glow appeared beneath her feet that turned into a flying shuttle.</p><br/><p>The flying shuttle was surrounded by swirling lights as it rapidly expanded to a size of nearly three hundred meters. Demonic Qi pulsed off of it in ripples, distorting the images of the stars and causing ghost images to spring up.</p><br/><p>She turned to look back at him and said, \u201cOkay little Meng Hao, I\u2019m gonna take off now. Don\u2019t miss me too much! Of course, if you really miss me, then once you have the ability to fly through the stars, then come to Planet East Victory. Who's to say whether or not I might let you have some alone time with me?\u201d She laughed. Right now, she seemed to have returned to the way she was when Meng Hao met her for the first time.</p><br/><p>Seductive as silk, eyes charming and amorous, she smiled and then transformed into a beam of light which shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao smiled and shook his head. For the most part, he and Zhixiang were partners in cooperation. However, after everything that had happened in the Demon Immortal Sect, gradually they had become friends.</p><br/><p>He looked away from her retreating figure and then sat down cross-legged on a nearby stone fragment. Zhao Youlan\u2019s eyes were still closed as she lay next to him, slumbering. The two of them remained in the river of stars as it shot through the starry sky. Soon, everything became quiet.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao stared out at the endless stars, and soon, a look of anticipation appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cCultivation. Immortal Ascension. Flying among the stars\u2026. It\u2019s all a journey. If I can leave the lands of South Heaven and enter the starry sky, my journey would be even more wonderful.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, Planet South Heaven would only be a bit of scenery along my way.\u201d Suddenly, Meng Hao smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy gains in the Demon Immortal Sect were tremendous!\u201d he thought. He looked down at his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cMountain Consuming Incantation, Nine Heavens Destruction, Nine Heavens Treasured Body Seal\u2026. Plus there\u2019s the Withering Flame Demon Magic True Self Dao. All of these divine abilities are there in my mind, as well as quite a few other minor arts.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, I have a good collection of lost treasures from the Demon Immortal Sect, as well as Ji Mingfeng\u2019s bags of holding. Most important of all is the sword tip from that Wooden Time Sword!\u201d When the thought of the sword tip, his heart palpitated with eagerness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sword tip has 30,000 years of Time power. If I actually used it, it wouldn\u2019t truly be 30,000 years, but it would still be shocking.\u201d He rubbed his bag of holding, his eyes gleaming brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then, there\u2019s the precious treasure from the Fourth Plane, the continental mirror!! There are countless magical items stored inside, as well as Demon Weapon Lonelytomb, and the shadows of those three Paragons!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe continental mirror is a precious treasure of true spirit Night. Taking it away was what awakened Night. Considering how valuable Night considered the treasure to be, well, it only serves to prove that my copper mirror has a mysterious origin.\u201d When he thought about the transformation the copper mirror had experienced, he once again had the feeling that his gains in this adventure had been exceeding.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the acquisitions will surely attract quite a bit of prying. All the other remaining South Heaven Cultivators are cruel and unscrupulous, and definitely have ill intentions. Their Sects and Clans will quickly learn about everything that happened.\u201d His eyes flickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for how much all those people owe me, if you add it together, it\u2019s more than ten million Spirit Stones! Which means that, right now, the main thing I\u2019m lacking\u2026 is Spirit Stones!\u201d He gave a cold harumph, but then thought to the debt pledges he had, and a brilliant smile appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe debtor must repay his debts; that is in line with the principles of Heaven and Earth! They can\u2019t escape that fact! Although, to be the most safe, I can\u2019t stay in the Black Lands or the Western Desert.\u201d As he sat there thoughtfully, many thoughts raced through his head.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Meng Hao sat there cross-legged, looking at the river of stars and the starry sky. Soon, he caught sight of a dot of light that was none other than Planet South Heaven.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he saw that, revolving around planet South Heaven was a shocking altar.</p><br/><p>As soon as he caught sight of the altar, he got a clear sense of a cold, gloomy aura. The aura swept toward him, but was blocked by the river of stars, and could not reach him.</p><br/><p>As the river of stars neared Planet South Heaven, Meng Hao stood up. He stared at South Heaven as it rapidly neared. Soon, he could see the lands below. He saw the Milky Way Sea, the Southern Domain and the Western Desert.</p><br/><p>As they shot downward, Zhao Youlan slowly began to regain consciousness. Before she could open her eyes, Meng Hao leaped up, shooting out from within the river of stars into the highest levels of the sky above South Heaven. Then, he transformed into a beam of light that shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p>There was a lot of pressure at such high altitude, but Meng Hao had been able to deal with the pressure at the 18,000 meter mark in the trial by fire of Lord Li\u2019s legacy. This pressure was nothing he would care about. He moved at incredible speed and quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>The river of stars began to rumble as it carried the confused Zhao Youlan down toward the lands below. As Meng Hao sped off into the distance, a cold, hoarse voice suddenly could be heard, accompanied by a slight chuckle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe pup from all those years ago has already grown up! His realm of Perfection really is perfect. I\u2019ve been waiting for a long time\u2026. It wasn\u2019t in vain that I covered your tracks before to confuse the Ji Clan. Child, the time has come to present your Perfect stratum to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by ExtremeGTP</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}
