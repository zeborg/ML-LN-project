The only thing visible were the lists of names, some of which were real and some assumed.</p><br/><p>Soon, the only thing Meng Hao could see was bright light, and then everything around him changed, even the sky; the altar seemed to become a massive, glowing spell formation. It didn\u2019t last for very long, only the space of a few breaths of time, and then the light vanished.</p><br/><p>Everything around him had changed. There was no sky up above, only stars. There was no ground beneath his feet, only a gigantic 3,000-meter long ancient beast!</p><br/><p>It was an enormous python, completely pitch-black in color, its body covered with scars and wounds. It was even possible to see its bones in some places, and in other locations, you could see all the way through its entire body.</p><br/><p>It appeared to be just on the verge of death, its life force fading, with barely enough energy left to even fly. Although it seemed to be just barely clinging to life, there was still a terrifying aura surrounding it it, the power of which shocked even Meng Hao. Were it to explode out, even a true Immortal would likely be killed by the blast.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was standing on the head of the ancient python, and it appeared to connected to him, as if he could control it.</p><br/><p>After staring in shock for a moment, Meng Hao looked down to find that he was wearing a suit of armor. The armor seemed brand new, and it radiated a mild energy. Overall, he seemed to physically be in this place, but at the same time, his body also seemed to be illusory. Furthermore, up ahead of him was a planet!</p><br/><p>It was much, much smaller than Planet South Heaven, and in fact, might not even have been large enough to actually call a planet. Perhaps it was nothing more than a large asteroid. It also seemed completely unstable, filled with chaos.</p><br/><p>Almost as soon as Meng Hao laid eyes on the black planet, innumerable dots of light appeared that looked like eyes. All of the eyes opened and looked straight at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>An intense sense of crisis filled Meng Hao, and his mind trembled. Suddenly, whistling sounds could be heard, and, astonishingly, one thousand beams of light shot toward Meng Hao from the planet.</p><br/><p>Figures could be seen within these beams of light, figures that weren\u2019t cultivators, but rather, puppets!</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was not the only one to be seeing this. Each and every one of the cultivators on the Ancient Road of Dao Seeking was in a unique world of their own. What they were seeing and experiencing was exactly the same as Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered coldly, and he didn\u2019t instantly spring into action. Instead, he took advantage of the time it would take for his opponents to reach him, to further study the ancient python. It appeared to be severely wounded, and on the verge of death, although it clearly had the power to make one final attack.</p><br/><p>Such an attack would surely leave the beast completely dead in spirit and body. However, that final attack would surely be shocking, that much Meng Hao could tell.</p><br/><p>He frowned and sent his divine sense out, then sighed. All of the puppets flying out from the planet had peak Dao Seeking auras, though not one of them was comparable to a false Immortal.</p><br/><p>Just then, however, five auras suddenly exploded out from the planet, five auras that were all of the false Immortal stage. If that were all there were to it, it wouldn\u2019t be a big deal. But in that moment, yet another aura, even stronger than the others, exploded out.</p><br/><p>The planet shook, and ripples spread out in all directions. The energy rose up, growing more and more powerful. It was very similar to the asteroid-like planet, completely filled with a will of chaos and madness.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s face sank, and his eyes widened\u2026.</p><br/><p>It was a true Immortal!!</p><br/><p>\u201cOne thousand puppets, five false Immortals, and one true Immortal...so this is the trial by fire?</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to what Ling Yunzi said, I\u2019m supposed to kill all of these enemies within the time it takes an incense stick to burn. That\u2019s the only way to pass this stage. Ordinary attack methods would never be able to accomplish such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao muttered to himself as the more than one thousand puppets whistled ever closer to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way that this trial by fire will eliminate almost all the competitors in only the second stage\u2026.\u201d Meng Hao\u2019s eyes flickered as he looked down at the ancient python beneath his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis ancient beast is powerful\u2026. The last attack it makes before dying will be powerful enough to kill all those thousand peak Dao Seeking puppets. Or, if I wait a bit, I could kill the five false Immortals with it. If I wait until the very end to use it, then I could kill the true Immortal.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only have one shot\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the choice we competitors are being given!\u201d The light of understanding flashed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>In the various other worlds in which the cultivators on the Ancient Road of Dao Seeking all faced the same scenario, everyone was hesitating regarding how to stick out from the crowd. There were many Chosen hidden among the competitors, and they were all intelligent people. It only took them a moment to come to the exact same conclusion Meng Hao had about the crux of this stage.</p><br/><p>The masked young man looked out with flickering eyes. Without hesitation, he shot out to fight the more than one thousand peak Dao Seeking puppets, intending to use the ancient python\u2019s final attack to kill the true Immortal.</p><br/><p>Such a decision was audacious, and required incredible self-confidence.</p><br/><p>As for the old man with the age-changing transformation ability, his eyes flickered as he chose the same tactic.</p><br/><p>There were, however, quite a few cultivators who chose to use the ancient beast\u2019s powerful attack first, rumbling out and slaughtering the thousand peak Dao Seeking puppets. After the puppets had been completely wiped out, the cultivators would step forward themselves to fight against the five false immortals.</p><br/><p>There were multiple cultivators who made each of the various choices. Shortly, the echoing sound of booms and the glow of magical abilities rocked Heaven and Earth within each of the various worlds.</p><br/><p>However, the actual scenes playing out within these worlds was hidden to the observers out in the Ninth Mountain and Sea; the only thing they could see was the list of names and the numbers representing the kill count next to each name, which were quickly soaring.</p><br/><p>As for the high-level Patriarchs from the Three Great Daoist Societies, Four Great Clans, Five Great Holy Lands, and the Three Churches and Six Sects, they were all sitting cross-legged in an enormous palace in the starry sky, staring at an enormous ancient mirror.</p><br/><p>The mirror was split into three sections, within which could be seen clear images of everything that was happening on the three Ancient Roads.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat masked young man chose the hardest path, but from that, you can see that his heart is as resolute as a boulder. He definitely has potential.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat cultivator with the age-transformations is most likely an apprentice of Patriarch Mirage. He might also be a rogue cultivator, but in any case, it\u2019s quite rare to see cultivators of the Dao Seeking stage who practice time transformation magic.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many potential stars in this trial by fire\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the three choices given them, we can learn about their personalities. Although, it doesn\u2019t matter which choice they make, as long as they pass this stage, they can be considered Chosen!\u201d</p><br/><p>The old Patriarchs discussed the matter calmly, occasionally glancing at the Ancient Roads of the Nascent Soul and Spirit Severing to identify people they deemed worthy of notice.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao, naturally, also received some attention. And yet, on the outside, there were currently no numbers displayed next to the name Fang Mu.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the Patriarchs were continuing to discuss the matter\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm. That young cultivator with the mosquitos is the first one to make an unexpected move.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also that kid in the yellow robe. He didn\u2019t make any of the obvious choices either!\u201d</p><br/><p>All eyes in the palace were fixed on one of the scenes playing out on the mirror\u2019s surface. The young man with the mosquitos waved his hands, causing his mosquitos to fly toward the python, whereupon they stabbed their mouthparts into it and began to absorb its blood.</p><br/><p>Another image depicted a young man who had performed unremarkably in the first stage. His body suddenly went blurry, and he fused down into the python. He quickly took control of it and set it to fighting, hoping to use it to kill both the puppets and the false Immortals.</p><br/><p>Not too much time passed before other cultivators also began to use various unorthodox methods that did not conform with the three obvious choices. None of the members of the crowd in the palace seemed to find this unexpected, and in fact, had apparently predicted that such a thing would happen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is excellent. There are far more people doing the unexpected than in the last trial by fire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom ancient times until now, there are always competitors in the Ancient Road\u2019s trial by fire who make breathtaking achievements in their later days. This group of cultivators is not bad at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come that Fang Mu hasn\u2019t done anything yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Amidst their chatting and laughing, some people had been paying attention to Meng Hao all along. Instantly, all eyes turned to the image portraying Meng Hao. He stood atop the head of the python, seemingly in a daze as the more than one thousand puppets bore down on him. They were now only about three hundred meters away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Fang Mu most likely doesn\u2019t have any plan at all. It\u2019s not uncommon for cultivators to struggle when it comes to making decisions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s too bad. I\u2019d hoped to see if he could perform exceptionally well in the second stage too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor someone to take first place in two stages in a row isn\u2019t unheard of, but isn\u2019t very common either. Unfortunately, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not the type that can do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the puppets whistled toward him, Meng Hao\u2019s eyes glittered, and his lips turned up slightly into a cold smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three choices seem different, but in fact, they are the same. Perhaps by using some unexpected tactics, it would be possible to introduce some degree of variation in the results. However, even if you were able to wipe all of these things out, that would be overlooking something even more important!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that is\u2026 that planet!\u201d His eyes shone with a strange light as he looked at the planet.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn truth, this python has another function other than its one attack... and that is the power of flight!</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore I proceed, though, I need to test out whether or not this body is real!\u201d Eyes glittering, he suddenly reached his right hand out and then slapped it down hard onto his chest.</p><br/><p>A boom rang out, his body trembled, and his eyes began to glow with a brilliant light. He\u2019d felt like something was off as soon as he\u2019d entered this place. Although everything seemed real, after experiencing the illusory world of the ancient Demon Immortal Sect, he had a much deeper understanding of such things.</p><br/><p>In all the other worlds, everyone was already in the midst of furious fighting.</p><br/><p>In Meng Hao\u2019s world, the puppets were closing in. Meng Hao suddenly sat down cross-legged and then stretched his hands out to rest on the ancient python\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The python\u2019s eyes turned bright red, and it let out a roar. Then its body burst into flames as it used the last scraps of its life force to shoot forward at blinding speed.</p><br/><p>The puppets scattered as the python swept through them. Even the five false immortals were incapable of blocking it. It moved with shocking speed as it carried Meng Hao directly toward the planet.</p><br/><p>As soon as it reached the planet itself, the python collapsed into bits of ash that vanished. At the same time, the aura of a true Immortal exploded out from within the planet. A figure flew out, wreathed in golden light, moving with astonishing speed toward Meng Hao, who had just stepped foot onto the planet itself.</p><br/><p>Its energy soared, and it looked like a windstorm as it bore down on Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>However, even as it neared, a vicious expression appeared on Meng Hao\u2019s face, and he unleashed the Star Plucking Magic. A huge hand appeared that grabbed onto the golden figure, after which, Meng Hao closed his eyes. With ruthless decisiveness, he caused his cultivation base\u2026</p><br/><p>To detonate!</p><br/><p>The power of the self-detonation was channeled directly into the golden figure through the Star Plucking hand. It didn\u2019t matter how incredibly powerful this figure was; its body was filled with roaring and, because its aura was chaotic to begin with, the power of the self-detonation compelled its inner aura to become even more turbulent, such that the figure was also forced...</p><br/><p>To self-detonate!</p><br/><p>A massive boom rattled out as both Meng Hao and the figure self-detonated together. The entire planet was then thrown into instability, causing it to shatter into countless pieces. A massive destructive power was unleashed as the fragments then transformed into a black hole which began to suck everything in!</p><br/><p>The puppets and false Immortals had no time to fight back; they were instantly swallowed up by the black hole.</p><br/><p>In the palace in the starry sky, the members of the crowd looked on in stupefaction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}
