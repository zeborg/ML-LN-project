It began to shine with dazzling light, light that was none other than the convergence of his life force, and everything that was him.</p><br/><p>It was also the light of his very soul!</p><br/><p>Draw the bow, converge the light, form an arrow!</p><br/><p>A dazzling spell formation appeared beneath his feet, and he took a step forward, his eyes flashing like lightning. When he released his grip on the bowstring, the string instantly began to vibrate with a shocking noise that left all the Outsiders\u2019 minds reeling.</p><br/><p>It was a noise that could rip apart the Heavens, a noise that resonated in the minds of all cultivators and Outsiders, a noise which represented death and killing!</p><br/><p>Anyone with an unstable mind would find their thoughts in complete disorder, and would feel terror rising up within them. Such people would even find their cultivation bases thrown into chaos, wrested completely beyond their control.</p><br/><p>That sound could destabilize Dao hearts!</p><br/><p>As Meng Hao released his grip, the bowstring began to propel the arrow formed from the light of his life force. It instantly seemed to suck in all the light in the area, turning the starry sky black, and making the dazzling arrow the center of all attention.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d Meng Hao growled as the light arrow began to speed forth. At first, it wasn\u2019t necessarily very impressive. However, in the blink of an eye, it grew from 30 meters long to 300, then 3,000, and then 30,000!!</p><br/><p>It took only a split second for the 30,000-meter-long light arrow to begin rumbling toward the millions of Outsiders who were trying to block the way to the other land masses, a group which included Imperial Lords.</p><br/><p>Heaven and Earth went dim, a massive wind kicked up, and the Outsiders\u2019 minds were completely shaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat bow....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis cultivator....\u201d Massive waves of shock battered at the hearts of the Outsiders. Meng Hao was like an Immortal Divinity; the glowing spell formation beneath his feet illuminated him, and the azure bow was so striking that the Outsiders couldn\u2019t help but stare at it.</p><br/><p>The Outsider Imperial Lords who were trying to block Meng Hao were shaken, and then roared as they transformed into their true Outsider beast shapes, unleashing their cultivation base power as they sallied forth to try to destroy the light arrow.</p><br/><p>However, a moment later, the light of the arrow engulfed them, and booms rang out, mixed with bloodcurdling screams. The Imperial Lords were completely incapable of blocking the arrow, and after it passed by... they were all dead!</p><br/><p>Gasps could be heard as the light arrow then blasted into the Outsider army itself. Wherever it passed, scorching light gave rise to miserable shrieks. Countless Outsiders were directly incinerated as the huge arrow cut a gaping path through the army!</p><br/><p>Over a million Outsiders. A host of Imperial Lords. None of them were capable of doing a single thing to stop the arrow from piercing through the army. Rumbling sounds could be heard as it shot toward the 16th Heaven, and then hit it!</p><br/><p>The entire 16th Heaven began to shake, and vast crevices snaked out. It only took a moment for the entire land mass to be on the verge of collapsing.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao himself transformed into a beam of light that followed the arrow. He shot through the path that had been carved out through the army, and as he closed in on the 16th Heaven, he once again began to pull back on the bowstring.</p><br/><p>\u201cMythdragon!\u201d he roared, voice bursting with killing intent, a shockingly murderous aura radiating out from him. After firing that first arrow, he was somewhat emaciated, and yet that murderous aura of his was as stupendous as ever!</p><br/><p>As he pulled back on the bowstring with his right hand, his qi and blood boiled, as once again a vast amount of it was sucked away. Meng Hao now looked extremely gaunt, and yet the second arrow formed completely, whereupon he loosed the string. The arrow of light shot out, bursting with energy that could shake Heaven and Earth, filled with a viciousness that could exterminate anything and everything.</p><br/><p>The arrow split open the starry sky as it shot toward the 16th Heaven, locking down onto an area in the very center of the land mass!</p><br/><p>There, Mythdragon was completely absorbed in recovering from his injuries. Suddenly, his eyes opened, and within them could be seen shock and apprehension. Gritting his teeth, he suddenly turned blurry, and a second image of him appeared. One of those images then stepped forward: his clone.</p><br/><p>The clone emerged from Mythdragon\u2019s Immortal\u2019s cave, outside of which several dozen Dao Realm Outsiders stood guard. All of them were pulsing with energy as they looked up into the sky at the incoming light arrow, behind which flew Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>By this point, though, there were few people who could do anything to save Mythdragon; on the same token, there was no one who could help Meng Hao. Apparently this land mass was fated to be the location of their final showdown!</p><br/><p>Outside of the land mass itself were millions of Outsiders, most of whom wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the 16th Heaven in time. However, all of them could unleash various divine abilities, creating an ocean of magic that rumbled toward the 16th Heaven.</p><br/><p>However, in terms of the time frame involved, such an attack wouldn\u2019t do much good unless Meng Hao took an unusually long time to kill Mythdragon.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, countless Mountain and Sea cultivators were in the Mountain and Sea Realm, beneath the seal, watching as Meng Hao single-handedly fought his way through the Outsider land masses, all for the purpose of... killing a Paragon!</p><br/><p>Everyone, whether they knew Meng Hao personally or not, was shaken. In fact... all of the Outsiders from the 17th Heaven all the way to the 33rd Heaven, who were watching but unable to descend into battle at this exact moment, were equally shocked.</p><br/><p>By now, Meng Hao was the most majestic and glorious Mountain and Sea cultivator in the war! In addition to him, there was Ksitigarbha. Their use of the sun and moon respectively had made them thorns in the sides of the Outsider army.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can buy enough time,\u201d thought Mythdragon, \u201cthen this Meng Hao... will have to face the deadly threat of the ocean of magic unleashed by the others!\u201d Mythdragon\u2019s clone threw his head back and howled, then flew out to meet the light arrow. The numerous Outsider experts who were serving as Dharma Protectors all howled as they reverted to their true forms, then gathered in formation around Mythdragon\u2019s clone to defend against the light arrow!</p><br/><p>BOOOOMMMMMM!</p><br/><p>The light arrow plowed into the Outsider Dharma Protectors, causing booms to echo out, along with miserable cries. They unleashed various divine abilities, but nothing did any good. Regardless of the levels of their cultivation base or fleshly body, they were instantly transformed into ash!</p><br/><p>Then that ash faded like wisps of smoke within the light of the arrow!</p><br/><p>Only Mythdragon\u2019s clone remained. He quickly performed a double-handed incantation, transforming into a huge black dragon. Roaring, he head-butted the light arrow, which faltered. Mythdragon\u2019s clone howled as he erupted with the aura of a Paragon. He might just be a clone, but he was still a Paragon, and his unleashing of power caused the arrow to begin to fade away.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that a cold snort echoed out. Meng Hao, instead of falling back, once again began to pull back the bowstring, unhesitatingly unleashing a third arrow, and then a fourth!</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUMMMMBLLLLE!</p><br/><p>The third arrow shot forth in spectacular fashion, causing the clone\u2019s eyes to widen in despair. Gritting his teeth, he then opted to self-detonate.</p><br/><p>The burgeoning self-detonation of a Paragon clone instantly caused the land mass of the 16th Heaven to begin to crumble, sending fragments blasting out in all directions. The second arrow was destroyed in the self-detonation, but most of the third arrow remained, and as it closed in on the source of the clone\u2019s self-detonation, even more explosive self-detonation power erupted out.</p><br/><p>Massive booms echoed out as the entire land mass was completely destroyed. Within the rubble, Mythdragon\u2019s true self flew out from his secluded meditation chamber, blood oozing out of the corners of his mouth. He looked elderly and weak; he had just reached a critical juncture in healing his serious injuries, and had then been interrupted, sacrificing more than half of his blood and essence to make a clone. All of that left him unprecedentedly weak.</p><br/><p>In fact, this was the weakest he had ever been since becoming a Paragon, and also the most dangerous situation he had ever faced.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Hao, I'm going to exterminate your entire clan!!\u201d Mythdragon roared, his eyes crimson. Bleeding from numerous wounds, he fell back into retreat. And yet, Meng Hao\u2019s fourth arrow was hot on his heels.</p><br/><p>From the look of it... that arrow would not stop until he was dead!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo ahead and try that,\u201d Meng Hao responded to Mythdragon's retreating figure.</p><br/><p>Even as the words left his mouth, the fourth light arrow suddenly exploded, blasting onto Paragon Mythdragon with full force.</p><br/><p>Shockwaves spread out into the starry sky, and Paragon Mythdragon let out a bloodcurdling scream. However, he wasn't dead yet. Although he was coughing up blood, he still managed to scramble away in flight, simultaneously transforming into a 30,000-meter long Black Dragon. And yet, that Black Dragon was a mass of mangled gore, with a severely weakened aura that was on the verge of dropping out of the Paragon stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me, Xuan Fang!!\u201d Mythdragon shrieked as he fled. Fear had blossomed in his heart; this was the most desperate situation he had ever been in since becoming a Paragon, and also the most terrifying.</p><br/><p>The feeling of imminent death was even greater than when he had simultaneously fought Sea Dream and the Daoist Societies!!</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody can save you,\u201d Meng Hao said softly. \u201cThis Mountain and Sea War has reached the point... where the blood of a Paragon is needed to cleanse the Heavens.\u201d Although his body had been weakened to the point where he was little more than skin and bones, his eyes shone with even more brilliant killing intent than before.</p><br/><p>He looked at the bow in his hand, then suddenly laughed. Eyes cold and grim, aura bursting with murder and madness, he began to pull back the bowstring back. But then, he slowly loosened his grip.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be quite a pity for him to die like this....\u201d A crimson glow rose up in his eyes, and he suddenly took a deep breath. Boundless blood-colored light exploded out from him as the Blood Demon gradually formed behind him. Unlike previous occasions, the Blood Demon superimposed with Meng Hao, merging into him.</p><br/><p>Blood-colored light exploded up from Meng Hao, and he threw his head back and roared. His eyes were bright red, filled with a bloodthirsty, icy light. He took a step forward, and then transformed into a huge sea of blood that shot toward the Paragon!</p><br/><p>He planned... to use the Blood Demon Grand Magic... to consume Mythdragon!</p><br/>\n</div>"}
