Memories of the times he had spent with her filled his mind.</p><br/><p>The first time he handed her a medicinal pill in the Reliance Sect. Outside the Immortal\u2019s cave in the Reliance Sect, when he gave her a Cosmetic Cultivation pill. Her voice underneath the moonlight. Then their time together in the Black Sieve Sect Blessed Land. And now.</p><br/><p>For some reason, it seemed as if many stories lay therein.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao wasn\u2019t sure if this was romantic love. The feelings within in him now were things he\u2019d never felt before, never experienced. What he did know was that every time he saw Xu Qing, he felt happiness well up within him that seemed to have been buried deep in his memories.</p><br/><p>It was a good feeling.</p><br/><p>In fact, during his five years in the Violet Fate Sect, the thing he found himself thinking about most often was cold Xu Qing, standing under the moonlight, her black hair floating in the wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder what it would be like\u2026 if the Reliance Sect were still there, if the Black Sieve Sect hadn\u2019t taken Elder Sister Xu away? What if we were still back in the Reliance Sect?\u201d Meng Hao looked forward again. The moonlight shone down onto his back as he proceeded off into the distance. Questions such as that had no answer.</p><br/><p>He drew further and further away\u2026.</p><br/><p>Two days later, a pair of prismatic beams shot through the air above a path to the teleportation portal which led to the Barren Mountains. They were none other than Meng Hao and Zhou Dekun. Their task having been accomplished, they were now on their way back to the Sect.</p><br/><p>After leaving the Black Sieve Sect, Zhou Dekun, had cleared his throat and then said, \u201cAiii. You should get out of the Sect more often and make more friends with these Cultivator Clans. You know what? How about this: I\u2019ll take you to meet some of them while we\u2019re on our way to the teleportation portal.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking sorrowful, he had continued, \u201cWe\u2019re Furnace Lords, and we spend most of our time holed up in the Sect. You can\u2019t deny that concocting pills takes a lot of resources. What you can earn in the Sect isn\u2019t enough to survive on. So\u2026 ah, Fang Mu, whenever you get sent out of the Sect, don\u2019t be in a hurry to get back. Take some time to interact with the outside. They have wealth to spare, and are the perfect companions for alchemists like us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao had nodded approvingly. After the events in the black Sieve Sect, the previous hard feelings between him and Zhou Dekun had disappeared. They now had a relatively good relationship.</p><br/><p>Thus, Zhou Dekun spent the better part of half a month taking Meng Hao to the various Cultivator Clans in the region, as well as to a mid-sized Sects, where they were received with great ceremony. No matter where they went, they were treated with utmost respect. Seeing the pretentious air with which Zhou Dekun carried himself amongst these Cultivator Clans made Meng Hao smile.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, whatever needs they had were met; in fact, whenever there were opportunities to sell medicinal pills, the Spirit Stones came flowing into their bags of holding. That caused Meng Hao\u2019s eyes to shine brightly. During the half month, he was able to sell quite a few medicinal pills.</p><br/><p>Actually, most of the pills he had sold were ones he had acquired from Chen Jiaxi.</p><br/><p>Finally, half a month later, Meng Hao and Zhou Dekun were nearing the teleportation portal that led to the Barren Mountains</p><br/><p>The Barren Mountains were located very near to the center of the Southern Domain, an area that could be considered a major intersection between the various Sects and Clans. Because of the location of this teleportation portal, it had eventually turned into a centralized travel hub.</p><br/><p>In a valley in the east of the Barren Mountains was a location that usually bustled with activity. Now, however, it could only be described as gruesome.</p><br/><p>The reek of blood filled the air, and the ground was littered with corpses. Searching through the corpses for bags of holding were a few dozen Cultivators who wore black robes and white masks. Occasionally they would encounter someone gasping their last breaths, and would immediately run them through with a sword.</p><br/><p>Beyond the black-robed Cultivators was a black, iron cage, several meters tall. Considering the cage floated in the air and emanated a mysterious glow, it was obviously a magical item. Inside the cage were two Cultivators.</p><br/><p>Their faces were pale, and they were both unconscious. They were splattered with blood, and were clearly seriously injured, but not dead. A faint aroma of medicinal pills emanated off of them; they were obviously alchemists. One of them wore a long green robe, which was embroidered with a pill furnace, marking him as an alchemist of the World Pill Division.</p><br/><p>Not too far away, three Cultivators were locked in magical combat in mid-air. Ripples spread out through the air. This was not the magic of the Nascent Soul stage; however, the level of power made it obvious that they were not Foundation Establishment Cultivators, but rather Core Formation.</p><br/><p>Of the three Core Formation Cultivators, two wore black clothes and azure masks. Their attacks were vicious; they were only of the early Core Formation stage, but were clearly beyond normal.</p><br/><p>As they attacked, booms filled the valley.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?!\u201d roared the besieged Core Formation Cultivator. \u201cI\u2019m from the Golden Frost Sect\u2026.\u201d Blood sprayed from his mouth as he shot backward.</p><br/><p>There was no response to his question. Of the two azure-masked Cultivators, one was pudgy, the other skinny. They advanced forward, their attacks growing even more vicious.</p><br/><p>It was at this exact moment that suddenly, one of the three teleportation portals in the valley began to glow. As soon as the glow rose up, the group several dozen Cultivators with black robes and white masks began to close in on the portal.</p><br/><p>The glow of teleportation lasted for the space of a few breaths, and then slowly began to disappear. Two figures appeared: Meng Hao and Zhou Dekun.</p><br/><p>Zhou Dekun was laughing and saying something to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a good relationship with several of the Cultivator Clans in the Barren Mountains. Next, I\u2019m going to take you to\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Hao was smiling, but in an instant, his expression immediately changed. Even as the teleportation was completing, before he and Zhou Dekun could see anything on the outside, a sense of danger rose up within him.</p><br/><p>Before he could speak, the sense of danger rose to the heavens. Meng Hao\u2019s face changed. He flicked his left sleeve, and a wild wind sprang up, rippling toward Zhou Dekun and knocking him to the side. Borrowing some of the momentum, Meng Hao\u2019s body snapped like a willow branch off at another angle.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao and Zhou Dekun flew off into opposite directions. Almost in the same instant that they left the teleportation portal, a boom filled the air as the combined magical might of the dozens of Cultivators slammed down onto it.</p><br/><p>As the boom echoed out, Meng Hao shot backward nine meters, both hands flashing incantation gestures and then waving out in front of him. Popping sounds rang out as the incoming power of the dozens of Cultivators dissipated.</p><br/><p>Zhou Dekun\u2019s face flickered. After being pushed off of the teleportation portal by Meng Hao, his right hand flickered in an incantation sign and then slammed into the ground. A great beam of light shot out from his body, blocking the power of the magical attack. Despite being of the late Foundation Establishment stage, blood sprayed from his mouth. His eyes filled with astonishment and fury as he looked at his attackers.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s eyes filled with a cold glow. It had been a long time since he engaged in battle magic with anyone. During his five years in the Violet Fate Sect, he hadn\u2019t made even a single attack against anyone. However, his skill in battle magic, and his ability to kill, had by no means been reduced. In fact, his five years of hibernation had made him even stronger.</p><br/><p>Some of that had to do with the Dao of alchemy and the Dao of poison. During the past five years, he had concocted no small amount of poisons. Killing intent flickered in his eyes as he looked at the dozen or so Cultivators in black robes and white masks.</p><br/><p>The instant he saw them, he could sense the intense killing intent radiating off of them. He saw the corpses laying around on the ground, and the two people in the cage. He also could see the battle going on in the air off in the distance.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate at all. His right hand slapped his bag of holding, and the two wooden swords flew out. Their sword aura flared up; they had been kept in silence for a very long time, and now that they were out, a massive killing intent boiled up. This caused most of the black-robed Cultivators to turn their heads toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you!\u201d roared Zhou Dekun. \u201cI\u2019m a Furnace Lord of the East Pill Division. You\u2026\u201d He hadn\u2019t personally engaged in magical combat for a very long time. Ever since becoming a Furnace Lord, he had trodden a path filled with courtesy and respect. Yet just now, even before he could step off of the teleportation platform, he had been the victim of a sneak attack.</p><br/><p>Before Zhou Dekun could even finish speaking, Meng Hao saw the eyes of the black robed men beginning to glisten as they looked over toward the old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good,\u201d thought Meng Hao, his eyes flashing. Without a moment\u2019s hesitation, his body flickered, and he shot forward.</p><br/><p>He moved at incredible speed, the two wooden swords screaming next were like two Sword Dragons that charged directly toward two of the black-robed men. Before the two men could retreat, the wooden swords stabbed through their foreheads, coming out the other sides of their heads in fountains of red and white.</p><br/><p>Continuing forward, Meng Hao flashed an incantation and then shoved his palm forward. Multiple images of a hand appeared. They began to emit a roaring sound, then fell apart into small attacks which shot toward the black-robed men. The black-robed men instantly fell back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Zhou,\u201d Meng transmitted to Zhou Dekun, \u201cdon\u2019t forget the ability of the robe! Get out of here!\u201d The dozens of Cultivators immediately split into two groups, one of which headed toward Meng Hao, the other toward Zhou Dekun.</p><br/><p>Everything was happening too quickly. Zhou Dekun was in a panic. However, as soon as Meng Hao reminded him, he stamped his foot onto the ground. His Furnace Lord\u2019s robe began to glow, and suddenly he disappeared.</p><br/><p>He had just activated the teleportation function of the Furnace Lord robe, which he could only do three times. Seeing Zhou Dekun disappear, a cold snort filled the air. One of the two Core Formation Cultivators, the pudgy one, transformed into a beam of light and shot in pursuit of Zhou Dekun.</p><br/><p>As he disappeared off into the distance, his voice rang out, \u201cWe have some East Pill Division Cultivators delivered right to our doorstep. Brother Yang, I\u2019ll go catch the one that just ran off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a word, the other Core Formation Cultivator, the skinny one, resumed his battle with the man from the Golden Frost Sect, who was clearly seriously injured at this point. From the look of things, he would be slain at any moment.</p><br/><p>Down on the ground, the dozens of black-robed men turned their attention from Zhou Dekun to Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao didn\u2019t flee. His eyes glittered with killing intent, and the corners of his mouth turned up into a slight smile. It had been a long time since he had been able to make any sort of attack against anyone. These people in front of him were mere Foundation Establishment Cultivators. In Meng Hao\u2019s eyes, they were already dead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t killed anyone in five years. I guess you guys are going to make me break my record of abstinence!\u201d This was the first time in five years in which Meng Hao\u2019s Cultivation Base would explode to its full potential!</p><br/><p>-----</p><br/><p><em>This chapter was sponsored by Hein Haugeberg</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}
