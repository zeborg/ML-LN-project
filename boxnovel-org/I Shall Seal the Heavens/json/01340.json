He saw mountains and rainbows, plains and oceans.</p><br/><p>The spiritual energy here was abundant, ten times more so than in the Mountain and Sea Realm. In fact, there wasn\u2019t just spiritual energy, there was abundant Immortal qi, making the entire place seem like a celestial paradise.</p><br/><p>Luxuriant vegetation covered the surface of the land, and a blue sky stretched out in all directions. Cities and other edifices were everywhere, although they floated about in the air instead of being constructed on the ground. Immortal mountains could be seen, as well as waterfalls of stars that seemed to connect Heaven and Earth.</p><br/><p>The edifices were all exquisitely constructed, and gargantuan. They were ancient, filled with a boundless sense of time and history. Statues could be seen, and precious materials were available everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, this is the 1st Heaven....\u201d Meng Hao thought, feeling a bit shocked. Suddenly, a cold light flickered in his eyes, and his cultivation base erupted. Fleshly body power surged out, and he began to grow taller; in the blink of an eye, he was 3,000 meters tall!</p><br/><p>He had a Dao Sovereign fleshly body which could shake Heaven and Earth, and taking a mere step could shake lands and rock mountains. When his cultivation base power spread out, the Paragon Bridge appeared, radiating a pressure of extermination that caused the sky to flash with brilliant colors.</p><br/><p>There were hordes of Outsiders here guarding the 1st Heaven, and yet none had very high cultivation bases. It was with complete shock that they all looked toward Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>An ancient voice suddenly spoke from off in the distance. \u201cWho are you?!?! What are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Clouds and mist roiled together to form into a huge face that stared at Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm Meng Hao,\u201d he replied softly, \u201cfrom the Mountain and Sea Realm. I've come today to exterminate this world!\u201d With that, he clenched his hand into a fist and punched down toward the ground.</p><br/><p>That single fist strike caused the entire world to shudder and crack as the power of extermination spread out.</p><br/><p>It was none other than the Life-Extermination Fist!</p><br/><p>The power of that blow caused the lands of the 1st Heaven to shake. The shaking wasn\u2019t violent at first. It was like the shaking caused when a mayfly alights onto a leaf. However, at the same time, all of the plants and vegetation nearby on the surface of the land instantly withered and died!</p><br/><p>It was as if the life force had been sucked out of them! A gray shockwave spread out from Meng Hao\u2019s fist, and everywhere it passed, things withered!</p><br/><p>The Outsiders\u2019 faces fell when this happened, and the ancient face was filled with shock. However, before it could say anything, Meng Hao swished his sleeve, and a boom could be heard as the mist-face collapsed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao's eyes were now shining with a cold glint. To him, no cultivators lived here, only animals. From what he could tell, virtually all of the Outsiders in this world, including the ones with the power to take humanoid shape, were all just lizards!</p><br/><p>Although the buildings and the environment looked like the Immortal World, Meng Hao knew that it wasn\u2019t. This place... was more like an animal den.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnimals like you want to exterminate the Mountain and Sea Realm?\u201d Meng Hao shook his head, then unleashed another punch toward the land beneath his feet, then pulled his hand back and punched again. The second punch was the Bedevilment Fist, and the third was the God-Slaying Fist. As the lands trembled, the Paragon Bridge crushed down, causing cities and edifices which floated in the air to shake violently and list to the side. Then, Meng Hao\u2019s divine sense spread out, filling the entire world. His will superceded the will of the world itself, crushing down, unleashing unmitigated destructive power.</p><br/><p>He was a windstorm, causing mountains to crumble wherever he passed. The lands disintegrated, and the rivers flowed backward. Oceans roared, and vast crevices opened up, causing cracking sounds to fill the air as they spread out. It was as if countless dragons were burrowing out through the soil, shaking the entire world.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao took a step forward, appearing in front of one of the floating cities. He looked at it for a moment, and then his eyes flickered with determination. This was not the time for mercy and kindness. He suddenly recalled the destroyed planets within the Mountain and Sea Realm, and how the viciously grinning Outsiders hadn\u2019t even spared the mortals.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow animalistic, but then again, you really are just animals!\u201d His right hand clenched into a fist, and he punched out. Rumbling sounds echoed out, along with bloodcurdling screams, as the enormous city was completely destroyed.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao\u2019s divine sense had long since confirmed that within the 1st Heaven, all of the Outsiders were lizards. Furthermore, as a species, none of them lacked cultivation bases in the way that mortal humans did. No, all of these lizards, from birth, had the power of a cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Because of that, there was no question as to whether or not to wipe them out.</p><br/><p>He took a step forward, and as he did, he exterminated everything he saw. The land turned gray as the life force was sucked away, and the feeling of death spread out everywhere.</p><br/><p>Gradually, Meng Hao could detect a howling sound coming from deep within the land, something that originated, not from any Outsider, but from the will of the world itself!</p><br/><p>It could sense his determination to kill everything, which was why it had sent the Tribulation Lightning against him. Now that he was here in person, it was doing everything it could to try to expel him.</p><br/><p>The power of expulsion grew stronger, and yet, Meng Hao didn't care at all.</p><br/><p>With his Dao Sovereign fleshly body, divine sense that was eighty percent as powerful as a Paragon\u2019s, and the cultivation base of an Allheaven Dao Immortal, although he couldn\u2019t completely disregard such expulsion power, he could definitely fight back against it!</p><br/><p>Rumbling could be heard as cities collapsed and statues were destroyed. Countless Outsiders let out miserable shrieks as their scales exploded and they were annihilated. Meng Hao was like a god of death, wreaking destruction and slaughter wherever he went.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a roar echoed out, which came from none other than what had previously manifested as the face of an old man. It was an enormous, ancient lizard, which shot toward him from off in the distance. The power of a 5-Essences cultivation base rippled out, and yet before he could even get close, Meng Hao gave a cold harrumph, and the lizard lurched to a stop in midair, blood spraying out of his mouth. Meng Hao hadn\u2019t even waited for it to get close before unleashing a fist strike!</p><br/><p>A boom rang out as the ancient lizard was completely and utterly destroyed!</p><br/><p>Cries of misery could be heard ringing out from all corners of the world. There was a constant stream of pleas for mercy, as well as curses.</p><br/><p>Meng Hao looked at the sky and the land, then waved his hand, sending out Divine Flame. \u201cYou suppressed us, you sealed us, and you invaded us. If you want to assign blame... blame Heaven and Earth for being cruel, or blame life for being unfair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wherever the Divine Flame passed, destructive power burned everything away.</p><br/><p>The Blood Demon roared, and wherever it went the screams of lizards would echo out.</p><br/><p>Mountains and rivers were demolished, the skies shattered, and numerous buildings and cities fell out of the air. More and more cracks and crevices snaked out across the lands, which shook and began to collapse.</p><br/><p>From the position of the 1st Heaven itself, what was happening wasn\u2019t very clear. However, down in the Mountain and Sea Realm, it was obvious!</p><br/><p>Any cultivator of the Mountains and Seas could look up at the 1st Heaven, which had supplanted the starry sky, and could hear the booms echoing out, and see the dust and ash spreading out. In fact, there were even chunks of rock and rubble which were beginning to fall down.</p><br/><p>With every boom, the lands shook. There were even entire sections which began to crumble, deforming the landscape. The cracks spread out, and there were even some vast slabs as big as asteroids which began to fall down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe 1st Heaven is about to collapse!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt's really... really going to be destroyed!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt's Meng Hao. It's him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe attacked the 1st Heaven with the purpose of completely destroying it!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMountain and Sea Cultivators, fight to the death!\u201d The cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm were going wild, and their eyes gleamed with determination. Their wild shouts, their killing intent, and their will to fight caused the Heavens to grow dim.</p><br/><p>The Outsiders were trembling in shock as they saw their home shattering into pieces. All of a sudden, their will to fight was replaced with utter dread and terror.</p><br/><p>One side was empowered, the other side was demoralized. The balance of battle was instantly overturned!</p><br/><p>The sounds of fierce fighting rang out as the cultivators of the Nine Mountains and Seas began to fight back with a vengeance!</p><br/><p>The Imperial Lord howled, the Paragon raged, the Dao Sovereign was in a frenzy. And yet, there was nothing they could do to stop what was happening!</p><br/><p>The Heavens were collapsing!</p><br/><p>The Earth was shattering!</p><br/><p>The spirits of the cultivators of the Mountain and Sea Realm were rising. The inextinguishable spark of faith that burned within their hearts had been kindled by Meng Hao, and now, it was beginning to burn brightly!</p><br/><p>In the Eighth Mountain and Sea, Patriarch Reliance was floating above a battlefield filled with mountains of Outsider corpses. He was looking up into the starry sky, at the crumbling land mass that was the 1st Heaven.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, he began to laugh loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s my disciple! The Ninth Generation Demon Sealer! Meng Hao! Incredible!</p><br/><p>\u201cI ran from you for years, unwilling to be restricted, unwilling to become someone\u2019s mount. But now, you little bastard, what you\u2019ve done, and what you\u2019ve said have convinced me...</p><br/><p>\u201cHenceforth, I am willing to be Meng Hao\u2019s mount!</p><br/><p>\u201cI, the Patriarch... am completely willing, and will never have any regrets!\u201d Patriarch Reliance threw his head back and howled, then shot up into the starry sky. Now that he had made his decision to be Meng Hao\u2019s mount, he would fulfil the ancient agreement. He would be the Dao Protector of the Ninth Generation Demon Sealer without the slightest hesitation. Therefore, he flew up into the air to go meet Meng Hao.</p><br/><p>Guyiding Tri-Rain was there on Patriarch Reliance\u2019s head, giggling with happiness. She had been waiting for this day for a very, very long time....</p><br/><p>At the same time, a middle-aged man could be seen standing atop Mount Daqing, there on Patriarch Reliance\u2019s back, also looking up into the starry sky. He was suppressing the fierceness of his own gaze, but if he weren\u2019t, it would be completely shocking.</p><br/><p>He did not emanate the fluctuations of the Dao Realm, nor the Ancient Realm. He was not an Immortal, nor some type of spirit. In fact, he appeared to be mortal, without any cultivation base fluctuations at all.</p><br/><p>And yet, he seemed incredibly dangerous.</p><br/><p>Astonishingly, that middle-aged man was none other than Dong Hu!</p><br/><p>\u201cI, Dong Hu, have been taking care of this treasure for my entire life. It was not destined to be mine, which means that I have been preparing it for someone else. I realized that many years go, but by then, I had already become the spirit of the treasure\u2026. But what does that really matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Back in the very beginning, there were four boys who had been taken by Xu Qing to the Reliance Sect: Meng Hao, Wang Youcai, Fatty, and Dong Hu!</p><br/><p>After all of them were separated, Xu Qing entered the cycle of reincarnation, Wang Youcai lost his eyes to gain ultimate enlightenment, Fatty gained numerous wives and concubines, and Meng Hao made a meteoric rise.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, Dong Hu was standing on Mount Daqing, there on Patriarch Reliance\u2019s back as he charged up into the starry sky!</p><br/>\n</div>"}
